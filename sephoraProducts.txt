Comment: I called Discover and they told me Sephora didn’t try to post the refund for that transaction. I opened a dispute for that charge and weeks later Sephora fought back and my dispute was rejected. After back and forth with Discover card my case has been reopened and I am still awaiting for the final decision. This is actually a second time where Sephora toyed with me with my online return. First time which was about 2 years ago they “forgot” for 3 months to refund me for an online purchase. I had to call them to remind them to get my money back.

Comment: Well back to this recent order from 1-11, I ordered 3 items, thought they were all in stock as the website did not state otherwise, and after I placed the order I received a confirmation email. Well today, 1-15-19, received an email saying one of the items has been cancelled because it's not in stock!!! Shocker! The other two items, plus my free samples plus the items I chose by using my points have all shipped and I've received a tracking #. I can't wait to see if they screw this one up too. I hope I get the samples I picked and I hope I get the other items I chose from using my points. That's the only reason I shop at Sephora, because of the points and free samples. But Sephora ONLINE, you are bombing it right now. If someone like myself takes time to write a review you better believe I am aggravated as heck.It's a respect issue for me. Sephora do you respect and care about your customers? BTW I shop online because I don't like the whole in store "sales" experience. All they are trying to do is get their numbers (sales) up. They look at you and all they see are dollar signs. So I'm comfortable shopping online. What are YOU going to do about this?

Comment: Beware of the delay shipments and don’t assume it will come on time as they claim especially if you need the package in a rush and I don’t recommend paying for the flash shipping. You can get free 2 day shipping if you purchase over $50. It’s a rip off and the gimmick is to get you to shop regularly and spend all your money at Sephora. You can find deals just about anywhere online if you spend the time to research. Ulta and Macy’s often have better deals just on the common brands. Also, I have to mention the free samples are always wrong. They just send whatever they want or have. I don’t understand what is the point to let you choose if they will send you different than what you requested. It’s like hauling trash home.

Comment: After 10 phone calls about this and six e-mails, no one can figure out how to process the return, even though they know I did nothing wrong. They told me to just do a VISA dispute, but they are unwilling to confirm that this has happened via e-mail. VISA only wants the documentation via e-mail (they won't do the conference call the manager of Sephora suggested). So Sephora just stole $54 from me.

Comment: The ONLY bad thing I have to say is about the free samples. For one, they used to give 3 samples and NOT ONCE out of 1,000 orders have I actually received the free samples that I selected in my order. That is awful as I sometimes make a purchase JUST to get the samples I order. If they cannot give you the sample you actually order online, then don't allow the option to select. It is extremely frustrating. Then I end up having to go on eBay and BUY my sample anyway. They always advertise new perfumes as a free sample, but never have I ever received any of these new perfume samples ordered. Instead, I get three postcards with a dash of makeup primer by benefit. Those went right in the trash.Other than the clear problem they have with filling orders properly, (free sample mass confusion), it is a great experience. I shop at Sephora more than ANY store. There is just never a time when you have enough makeup and/or skincare products. Just when you think you are "good" a new invaluable product is released. Sephora is always the first to get new releases. VERY happy with Sephora.

Comment: In the meantime, I contact Sephora via Twitter and they said they can't do anything about in-store transactions even after I supply proof i.e. partial bank statement and receipt. Sephora via email said the same thing. That brings me to 3 phone reps, 2 email reps and a Twitter rep who all can't or won't help me because they're adamant I got my refund or they just can't. I've spent a lot of money with them and been a customer for many years. This month alone I spent $300. They're too big to care about one person but I refuse to shop with them anymore. I "cashed" in my 1000 points for a reward today and I'm done.

Comment: After 13 days of return, I still don't know if they received my return or not. I had another order received earlier in the month, I decided to return for it was not what I wanted, 100% unopen & unused. So I decided to use the prepaid label 'hassle-free' and 'easiest' way to return it. WRONG WRONG guys, after it was picked up by my local agent of USPS, the tracking info IS GONE FOR GOOD. And the only other tracking # on the smart shipping label Sephora uniquely has, is not valid for me to track at all on the USPS website. In another word, you will be blindly waiting for your refund and notice after you delivered it to USPS shipping office. The Smart shipping label they have - provide no information on where it is shipping to, the shipping method (2 days/ ground), so you will have no idea at all on the status. Contacted the customer services, they said please allow 3 weeks to process, ehhhh, how about an update please? Like is the shipment lost or not or received? Next time, I will definitely pass on the online shopping experience at Sephora, it is too much for my nerves when I cannot get a hold on when to expect what.

Comment: I asked if they could send them out to me since they were forgotten and she said “We can’t send out free samples by themselves; they must be included with an order”. I told her I would not order any products online through them again since the products I ordered are not guaranteed. She said they are guaranteed. I responded by saying they are not guaranteed because if they were I would have received it. I told her I have lost trust in their company and refuse to order online from them again. I’m disappointed that I did not receive the samples but I am extremely frustrated with their poor customer service. When I had asked for a manager, the associate told me she would say the same thing.

Comment: Since Sephora only attempts delivery once and needs signature, I will definitely not receive the order and they refuse to cancel it. Also stop using couriers please Sephora. They are horrible. I will never shop here again. I have already spent 100s at Sephora and would definitely be 1000s in the future because I love buying brand name makeup. I already have several Marc Jacobs products, a few Benefit, Kat Von D, Cover Fix, Zoeva, etc. All bought this year since I discovered Sephora. But Sephora is off the list now. I will shop directly at the brand or at Mecca or other department stores in my country. Never again Sephora. I gave you a chance to fix the situation but you refused. Now better companies will get my money.

Comment: Another customer walks in (a former employee) and EVERY woman in the store ignored customers including myself to stop and talk to her. Ask her if she was applying for seasonal help. Then the lady helping me told me about a product I may like after some chit chat. She was fake polite, but took her attention away from me to ask someone through the mirror if she made a sale off the previous customer. Then told me, "I apologize we are not disorganized like this." She then asked the makeup consultant if she would assist me. The makeup consultant came over, I told her what I was looking for and she told me to look online for the product because she does not have my skin tone. Then she ran back over to the former employee, sat her down and started a full makeover on her. You know this area is known to be high class and customer service is expected with that. My visit was horrible, I did not get recommendation, or products that I needed. Five days later I am contacted by Aimee ** Talent Business Operations Manager, who works at the store. So, I waited for a month and a half for a response from the District Manager. I have been in contact with Sephora customer service via email, who are now refusing to have the district manager contact me after asking me to wait 7 business days. I have contacted today, and I am now being told rudely four times by customer service to call so my issue can be addressed. Let me tell you this, the other locations I have been to in the last 5 states I have lived in, I have never had a problem with. The stores in the Memphis area have a reputation for snotty associates which I have found out for myself. This location is the lesser of the snotty stores from what I have been told. Now, I am two months out on horrible customer service, and now having to pull myself away from my life to make a complaint via Consumer Affairs because you cannot hire customer service or associates to do their job.

Comment: Well I have a pretty good idea why - with the in store only redeemable point scam, Sephora gains not only an additional full size product purchase with each redemption, but also avoids having to give the 3 free samples for all said purchases. And what does the customer gain? NOTHING! Nothing but having to spend more money for points they’ve been “gifted” along with the play box subscription that they have ALREADY PAID FOR! Not acceptable! Ulta is looking better & better these days!

Comment: I then called Customer Service, the agent said that my order has not been shipped at the time, yet I'm literally telling him my shipment ID number that can only be found in the packing slip. Why would a customer lie about receiving a package? He then tells me to wait and to call back. I went back and forth with Sephora about 6 times trying to get my items. Fast forward to August 14th, I get a notification that my order has shipped from Sephora online, but when I go to click on the tracking link it takes me to the same package that was grossly missing items. I then called Sephora Customer Service again raising all chaos. I paid with a Sephora Gift card that I received as a graduation gift from college. If I paid with a debit card I would have disputed the charge with my bank a long time ago. Sephora finally reordered my items free of charge for me through the phone to which I finally received it August 20th. What a darn shame, I had to wait a whole 11 days to get my complete order. I'm an avid online shopper that has never dealt with such abysmal customer service and empty packages. What is going on in the warehouses? Are the workers stealing the items? It makes no sense. Long story short, I will never purchase from Sephora ever again, not even in the flesh.

Comment: Trying to use the Sephora gift card online through the JCPenney app it was going to let me use it there except for JCPenney tells me that I have free shipping due to the amount spent but then will not let the order go through without me paying shipping and handling and does not give me the option to ship to store. This policy needs to be changed and the Sephora gift cards need to be able to be used at any Sephora no matter if they're purchased at the store online, at a JCPenney or any other store that Sephora might be in.

Comment: However, second time today, I did not get the item I want with the promo code used, AND instead of receiving 3 of the samples I have chosen, the packer just threw in 1 perfume sample. What happened to my promo code item? And the reason why I made those orders was because there are some samples I really wanted to try before purchasing a bigger size. What is the point of letting us choose the samples we want if Sephora is just going to throw in whatever they want? Understand samples do run out, and if it is really the case which I don't think is my case, so why didn't Sephora just update their samples page?Have read so many disappointing reviews on Sephora before I decided to write this today. And they are ALL same issues. Samples missing, Promo code item missing, lousy packing etc. Yes, I too received all items in boxes that are way too big with just a brown paper thrown in the box. Except for one order from Chelsea Rd Aberdeen MD, my item is bubble wrapped (thank you). Sephora you need to fix this issue before you start losing more customers. I don't think I will purchase anything online from Sephora again after I experienced excellent customer service from Beautylish this trip.

Comment: Another time I had placed an order (within the last 5 months), they shipped it to the wrong address. An address I lived at 3 years ago and was nowhere to be seen on my Sephora profile. How this happened, I have no idea and customer services also had no idea how this happened. Customer service have always been 'nice' for the most part, but they are very ineffectual. They offer to give points and that's all they really do. When I told them how incredibly disappointed I was in the downhill service with shipping, he told me that 'UPS is an amazing service'. I have a hard time believing that it's only UPS making all of these errors and think that Sephora has some culpability here.

Comment: Another week went by, no refund. Just called today, and the associate put me on hold a couple times, then came back and said the refund had been processed. “I should see the refund within 5 days.” I’m not sure what the issue was; if my return had been delayed via mail, if the return department was backlogged/busy, if my return just sort of slipped through the cracks - since no one in Sephora support mentioned anything, I can only assume that it was just incompetence in this instance, but in all my years of online shopping and the occasional mail-in return, I have never had anything like this happen. It seemed like my refund was only processed because I called about it TWICE. The first support associate didn’t mention if the return had been received late, if they hadn’t received it yet, or if it had just been received recently and the refund hadn’t yet been processed; she just said that it would be processed the following week or so. Anyway, very disappointed in the way this return/refund was handled.

Comment: When I asked who the third party was, what information they will be collecting and the purpose I was told she had no clue. Further, I was told that once I provide my passport, etc. there isn't a guarantee that they will allow me to exchange the item. I asked what they do with customer passports and driver licenses after the "check" is completed, where is the information stored? She again had no answers. THIS IS A HUGE SECURITY ISSUE!!! All this to return a $30 item for which I had an email receipt from their website. It is very POOR customer service. I will never purchase from them again.

Comment: SO I call customer service to cancel said order. Girl says, "No prob. You'll get a confirmation email in a day or so." 4 days later I get an email saying my order has already been shipped (shipped 2 days after I canceled the order) and that they were unable to cancel my order... SERIOUSLY??? So annoying, so moral of the story if you like your items to be delivered in a timely matter and enjoy receiving good customer service then you DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO ORDER FROM SEPHORA.

Comment: I went to a store in Boston and got makeup on my coat and it was so disorganized. I was told I would hear from the manager and tried to call back - but of course no one gave me a response. I went to the Cambridge store and was told straight out that something that would not look good on me wasn't in stock and then it was less than 24 hours later. You can't tell me they didn't have that in the back ready! Some places did already. The mail service is the worst. I got sent some old cleanser (verified the code) and some dried out lip gloss. This cleanser company HAS had old makeup on the shelves of Sephora before and no, they don't care, just push off the old product to customers. As long as they get their money too! Had to try to return it - told a credit would come right back to my bank account. Been 2 weeks now and have not seen!PayPal says I can't prove I sent it back when I CLEARLY had all the info so I might lose about 80.00 because of this horrible, unprofessional store as a whole. PayPal is also part of the problem because I showed them that I sent back it and the overseas people who work at PayPal do not understand how the USPS tracking works. The local stores are bad - the online is just as bad. A Reddit account posting says they deliberately don't refund quickly in case you have remorse and have to pay your bills instead because their makeup is so pricey. I say who cares, the store should refund the money in a timely manner, I'm reading on here sometimes they lie and say they don't refund it at all! I think they should be going above and beyond for customers. Especially because the stuff is so expensive. Or in my case, old, smelly, and defective.

When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told I would have to hang up, call again, hold for someone, etc. This is unacceptable and I wanted to share my experience. Thank you.

Comment: I was so shocked and wanted to tell corporate, I called and they told me that someone would contact me, on 1/29/2018 Valarie emailed me and asked me to call her that she would be at the store all day until 4:00pm. So I did and was put on hold for 8 minutes only for Alice to pick up the phone and tell me that Valarie was not at the store! That Sephora is not what it used to be, I guess I will have to shop for Kat Von D on her official site. I couldn't find Stila in the store and I couldn't ask Stacey because she had checks to validate and couldn't even answer a simple question.

Comment: We decided to leave because of how rude she was and as we were walking out, we heard Donna talking about the “two annoying girls” who wanted facials. We heard her say to a coworker “they don’t know what they are doing” and that we “have no place here”. To top it off, as we left the store and said “bye thank you” to be courteous, she mimicked us in a childish tone. She finished her remarks with “maybe next time you can try buying something”. Maybe it was just Donna, but I have also had similar experiences here at the Northpark Sephora. The customer service is lacking and I am yet to be back. I could have been a lifetime customer but Donna killed that potential revenue stream.

You entice customers to make a purchase in order to get 3 free samples and then say you don't have to send them?" I would like to note that I am a VIP customer and spend a lot of money on their products but after this conversation, I'll take my business elsewhere.

Comment: I told him I found it difficult to believe that Sephora would only allow one account per household. That it made no business sense and or just common sense either. He then started rambling on about how he wasn't trying to say my intelligence was sub par but that's how Sephora rules were. I explained again how I had purchased the items and used my card and checked out but he kept going back to the account with my husband's name on it. Well I became very annoyed and just hung up on him. I will wait and try to talk to someone who hopefully has better customer service skills. Also, after this order is corrected I will no longer be making any purchases from Sephora. I guess they do not value their customers and make you go through unusual hoops to correct their mistake(s). End of rant!

Comment: Once I realized It was the wrong item I contacted customer service and they were extremely rude and nasty. They informed me that there is nothing they can do, but to turn in the product and I should receive a refund. They also informed me that although the order filler at Sephora packed the wrong order that there wasn’t anything they can do because the product is now out of stock. This was a huge disappointment considering the fact that I‎t was in stock at the time of purchase. The customer service team was very unhelpful and rude to say the least. I will no longer be shopping at Sephora and will stick to Ulta or department stores.

Comment: I always shop in Ulta now, but because they don't carry Marc Jacobs I had to buy from Sephora again using my $20 off since I'm still a VIB this year. When my order arrived, all the samples were missing. I know that it's free but for your customer service to rub it in my face?? I emailed them what happened and I got something along the lines of "while it's nice to have freebies there's nothing we can do, now here's more points!" Are you serious?! They seem to be offering points to rectify everything and make irate customers go away. Now after reading most reviews, they seem to be not sending samples at all. Well how about please dont offer something you cant deliver.

Comment: I went back on Friday afternoon to purchase my products and they said, “we’re sorry but we thought you weren’t going to come back and we’ve already put the merchandise back on the shelves.” Are you kidding me??? It’s still within the 48 hours and no one even called me to find out whether I was coming back. I spend a lot of money at this store every month and all they could say is “sorry.” To make matters worse, several of the items I had on hold were gone from the shelves so I couldn’t purchase them for my daughter for Christmas. I did buy some items which I previously had on hold, but most were gone. I ended up buying $228.90 worth of products with nothing but “sorry.” I think their customer service and/or management is severely lacking. I believe they could have done something to make this awful experience better for me to ensure I would remain a loyal customer.

Comment: If the company is only going to give you whatever they might as well not let you select what items you prefer or correspond with you to make sure before they send out product that you will use it instead of wasting it. Honestly I'm more upset that Sephora isn't a company that is about its word, don't say or offer something that you're not going to actually do. Guess it's time to see what other beauty stores have to offer. However I did get the correct items I paid for so I'm happy about that, the package wasn't damaged and came earlier than estimated.

Comment: I am infuriated first that they couldn't process this in person because I used PayPal, and finally because of the poor customer service. I think it is poor service to make someone leave a store with a product that they are trying to return - and ask them to use another measure to get their money back. Terrible - especially for someone who spends so much money in that store.

Comment: For instance, they are currently advertising a "free sample bag with any order" of $35 and up, and list five different versions of the bag. I liked the bags so I ordered some makeup earlier than I usually would have, just to take advantage of the offer. Within 5 minutes of my order being placed, I was sent an email saying the sample bag was "canceled" because it was out of stock. Okay, well I'll get one of the bags still in stock, right? Nope. I was told over the phone that they won't substitute something else for the offer automatically, and after just a couple of minutes all orders will be "in progress" and it's "impossible" to make any change at that point. Yet that sample bag is still on their front page being used to get people to order, thinking they'll get this offer with their purchase! Sephora KNOWS it is out of stock. It's bait & switch and I'm DONE with it. It didn't used to be this bad; until about two years ago you could count on getting all your samples or a nice substitution if it ran out. Now Sephora refuses to honor their offers, and I suspect they never had any intention of doing so.

Comment: Needless to say, I am curious as to how they were able to establish this link. As further proof, they stated they were able to establish a link between me and the shipping destination. Again, I must question their link finding abilities because the product was shipped to Atlanta, Georgia and I have never lived, worked, visited, laid a fingernail in Atlanta, Georgia or any part of Georgia, for that matter. I don’t know if Sephora mishandles customer information in general or if they were outright lying to get out of reversing the charges, but I submitted a complaint to the California Attorney General detailing the inaccuracies contained in their statement. I suggest if anyone else has information about Sephora mishandling sensitive customer information, contact the California Attorney General. Hopefully, if they get enough complaints, they will investigate.

Comment: Recently, I have been having issues where orders I place are pending for days, and then eventually result in an "Unsuccessful Authorization." I have tried with multiple cards, entering my address in different ways, etc., but was still having the same problem. They never responded to the message I sent through their online contact form, and the 4-5 people I've talked to on the phone in the last 2-3 weeks have all given me conflicting information and have routinely told me things that were clearly just lies. For example, one representative told me that they had no way to know why the order was not going through, but another told me that it was definitely because my apartment number was listed on a different line on my billing address (even though I have placed orders like that in the past and it was fine).One representative told me it was because I tried to ship one of the orders to my mom, and another told me where I am shipping it wouldn't matter at all. Two of the representatives said that they would place a note in my account to make sure my orders would not keep getting cancelled in the future, since there is no apparent problem with my card, address, or account - however, the last person I talked to said there were no such notes. I had one representative manually place an order for me over the phone, and they said that there would be no issues, and sure enough... This order did not go through either.The one time I have recently been able to get an order to process, it was a disaster. I had an order that was pending for over a week, and I was assured that it was "absolutely" not going to process and that I needed to re-place the order. I re-placed the order, and sure enough, both orders shipped. When I called to notify them to cancel the one (which they did) I was still charged twice. Then for some reason they only issued a partial refund! I was still charged over $100 dollars for items I never received.My most recent experience was the most frustrating though. The most recent person I talked to very rudely mansplained to me for over 30 minutes about how I can't place orders with other people's cards or ship to other addresses (even though other representatives have told me those things shouldn't matter, and I have placed other orders like that just fine in the past). This doesn't even make sense because the first time I had this ordering issue it was with my own card and shipping to my own address. Even after spending almost 45 minutes on the phone total, they still couldn't tell me why I am unable to place orders on my account.Their advice was to call and verify my orders with their customer service every time I place an online order from now on - even though I have already tried that and this has not been successful. Even if that did work, who has time for that?! No matter how many times I asked, they would not transfer me to a manager. I wish I could take back the hours of my life back that have been spent on the phone and checking orders for products that I can just buy at other places. Clearly Sephora does not respect my time or money.

Comment: So she left and came back and said, "You can't open a Bottle of makeup to use as a sample." And I told THE MANAGER if they kept the testers ready then no one would need to open a bottle. I don't know if this color still works. I need to test it. And we went back and forth arguing about it until she finally decided the customer was right and looked in the drawer and found a bottle, opened it and used as a tester!!! This happens every single time I go in there. After all that I saw they had the right sample in the wrong labeled slot.

Comment: Finally she offers to reship, but at this point I'm hesitant because if it happened once, it could happen again. I ask her if she can ship overseas? No. Can she provide signature delivery confirmation? No. Can she leave a note with the delivery co. and tell them to A) please leave package in the mailbox, because you know, we have one. B) Ask the delivery person to come into the apartment building, knock on the door and deliver it into the hands of my mother. Or just send it straight to the post office. All no. Because I live in France (yes there is a Sephora here) and they do not carry the same name brands, I gave in and said okay, just reship the package. At the last minute she then tells me that one of the items I ordered was no longer in stock. So after suggesting to me for over 20 minutes to get a re-delivery of the same package I now find out one item is missing. The whole process was just one big headache. I asked for a refund and asked for an email confirming the approval for the return and still nothing! All I can say is NEVER AGAIN! Sephora, work out your delivery service because for the amount of money I'm spending, this type of thing shouldn't be happening.

Comment: Because of this experience Sephora has lost my business. And like me, Sephora had never seen such incoming business. Don't BOTHER trying out ANY benefit eyebrow waxing! It's not worth the horrid pain and displeasure of eyebrow appearance. I am soon leaving on vacation and because of Cinthyia, I am not fully content with my appearance, and for all you ladies hopefully reading this, we all know how we feel about our brows. No one can mess with them, unless you know what the hell you are doing. I am extremely displeased at Sephora mainly because the service is revealed as a life changing experience for women looking for a nicer look. Boy, did I get swindled. Like aforementioned, when you see the benefit brow bar ANYWHERE, keep walking. Get them waxed or attempt to try threading! That's really worth the strong pain, but as we women know. Beauty hurts!

Comment: I called last week and they said they were all canceled and the funds would be put back. I asked to speak with the Fraud dept and I was told I couldn't. They said that the situation would be investigated. I asked her "What if this guy has your card and does this to you?"... Silence.. She finally said she didn't know if they would do anything about it. I've got 200.00 in bills waiting to get paid. Thank God my husband didn't mail them.It's been almost a week and nothing's been done. We just called. We got the same runaround. They said they could cancel the one that already shipped out, but not the other three because there was no tracking number. SERIOUSLY?!?!? They don't cancel before they get shipped? I've never heard of such a thing. The agent kept trying to drop it and leave it at that. Luckily my husband was home and had a deeper voice than I. He deals with Verizon customers every day and knew exactly how and what to say. We still only ended up with one of them being canceled and 150.00 still up in the air. They said to give it a week to 10 until they are shipped. I'm wondering if they will require me to return them. Short of going to that address and banging on their door, I have no way to get those 3 lipsticks.Beware of Sephora. I am so angry right now. I love shopping at Sephora and now I have to cancel my account. We have adults here, so I can give them my business instead... In store. I have NEVER experienced customer service like this. It's mind boggling. Now I get to wait another week to call them again. I'm off to call my credit card and phone and explain why this month's bills aren't getting paid. So much for my credit score.

Comment: Second - this morning I was placing items in my cart that I was thinking about purchasing due to the 15% off sale. While doing so - I noticed that the Sephora Play! was open for subscription. I proceeded to subscribe. I was notified when doing so that the items already in my cart would be saved and not charged with the order. I proceeded. I got to the confirmation screen and chose which card I wanted to use and was told I'd be charged $10.97 (some change - don't remember exactly). I clicked that I understood the terms of Sephora Play! and clicked "charge". I was taken to a confirmation page. In less than a minute I received an email confirmation on my order. The confirmation was for $138 and not the $10. The website DID NOT order the Sephora Play! - it ordered the other items that were in my cart that it said it would not charge. I only verified the $10 charge - nothing more. I had to wait for Sephora's phone hours to open. Once I did, I was told that they couldn't cancel the order until it shipped. Now - okay - I kind of get this. BUT - they charged $138 to my account. That's $128 more than what I authorized. Yes, I had the items in my cart - but I wasn't even given the option add the bonus items that you can get - and I always charge my Sephora orders on my Discover due to getting Cash Back. So now, I have to wait and see if the order will be canceled. The kicker - there is only a 50% chance that it will be canceled. If it's not, I have to wait for the order to arrive at my door and then I have to ship it back. So, my account is $138 less for however long this is going to take. Ugh...

Comment: So I waited another week still no package arrived. Then I decided to call the post to check on the status, I found out that the delivery driver has delivered my products at a "Safe Place"...? But I said "How can it be delivered at a Safe Place when you don't have my apartment number or street number??? And I did not Sign for it???" So the said I can dispute this and they will try to locate exactly what went wrong. Oh... & that the delivery person is away on sick leave??? STRANGE! I'm still waiting on a response. I have also emailed Sephora. Explain all of this and also not much is being done. Only a representative emailed me today. They she will check with Australia Post On the status! Still waiting, I just contacted PayPal & disputed this & hopefully I get a refund as I have buyer's protection. I guess I will just have to wait & see!

Comment: After explaining this to a second "customer service" representative, I was simply given a link that shows shipping times - still not rectifying the situation or doing anything to appease me as a customer who spends hundreds of dollars a month at this company. Regardless of what representatives have said, according to Sephora's shipping guidelines, my order should have shipped and it did not. But bear in mind, when you sign up for Flash, you're agreeing to terms and conditions that basically say this expedited shipping is never guaranteed, so therefore you're throwing your money away. I would have just gone into the store, but I like the free samples that I get when I order online. Now I'll be cutting my ties with Sephora and shopping directly with the cosmetics brands I use.

Comment: Once I got "help" I was told I needed to already know the brand and type of foundation I wanted because she could only try ONE on me. And I needed her why? I went there so they could help me with that. So I picked a brand and she determined my color undertone. She came back with something else (in a different tone because she knew the other would be too light). I was very specific nothing with pink or peachy tone, she paid no attention. To say she was disinterested/bored is an understatement. Their mirrors are all dark coated so you can't determine much yourself. She kept pushing additional products. I purchased the foundation and was furious when I looked in my car mirror and saw my rosy pink face. Went back in and returned it. Will never go back. They act as if they are doing you a favor by even minimally doing their job.

Comment: I've attended a few of their classes, where I was ignored, spoken to condescendingly, made to feel less valued than others, and assumed to know nothing about makeup when I'm very knowledgeable about it. I'm actually passionate about makeup, and have lots of the products Sephora sells. But shockingly, I'm assumed to know nothing about makeup. It's fine to order online, but the stores are extremely discriminatory, judgmental, hurtful, and unfair. They really love and appreciate some customers while degrading and rejecting others.It's a terrible place to shop if you're not **, fairly attractive, look very expensive, and have that clubby Sephora vibe. Extremely exclusionary place. Do not spend any of your money there! Boycott Sephora for their severe discrimination and overt racism. By the way - I live in one of the most "progressive" cities in America, one that prides itself on "diversity." For Sephoras in my city to treat me this bad is absolutely shocking and hypocritical.

Comment: Several weeks later I received an e-mail stating that what had happened was they were unable to process my payment information so my monthly subscription was cancelled but that I could join the waiting list to subscribe again once there is room. To cancel my account and make me wait to join again when the error is the company's mistake is terrible customer service. I was told the payment was not processed and my account was not charged. That was not true. I was charged for two boxes in a row that I never received. It has been 5 months and I have gotten no where with customer service. Also there has been no room on the wait list in that time.As I begin to look online to see if this has happened to anyone else I am seeing that it has happened to a ton of people. I have worked in promotional marketing on a large corporate contract as a brand representative for 6 years now. After reviewing hundreds of claims that Sephora is stealing money from its customers all I am left thinking is, why has there not been a lawsuit over this??? If anyone is involving themselves in litigation for these matters with this company please contact me as my bank records clearly show that my payment was processed though I received no product from them.I will never purchase another item from them no matter what and I am absolutely not interested in subscribing to the MO they box again. Anyone looking for better offers should look into Ipsy and Birchbox (which are the same price as Play!) Or Julep which is pricier but really awesome. I have never been treated so rudely by a company and I think Sephora should be ashamed of how they ate conducting business. A quick search online reveals the company's history with racial prejudice towards anyone who is not white in addition to their shady dealings of stealing money from customers without shipping products. BOYCOTT SEPHORA!!! PASS THE WORD AROUND THE GLOBE!!! THIS COMPANY IS POORLY RUN AND IS UNETHICAL.

Comment: Since the tracking information showed the package had been on my street the day before, I was puzzled as to how my order could already be altered. Additionally, why was anything from my order being altered and given to other customers at no fault of my own? As I worked to frame my questions in a way the "beauty advisor" could understand, throughout continued and extremely frustrating interruptions, the only response I kept receiving was "your items are no longer available. Your items are no longer available. Your items are no longer available." That sentence rang through my head like a broken record. Why are the items that showed they were on my street just yesterday no longer available?The response, again by interruption, was "there is nothing I can do." I asked then if I could speak with anybody else that could explain why my items were no longer available and there was nothing he could do, but he said I would need to hang up, call back, and speak to someone else that way because he would not transfer me. I certainly understand triaging and managing calls in a way that reduces the number of escalations. But there must be a better sense of customer service or lack thereof than to recommend I hang up and speak to someone all over again. I'm shocked that Sephora would train their customer service representatives... Sorry, their "beauty advisors" this poorly. I did exactly as told by this pitiful representative, and was connected with another "beauty advisor". Lo and behold, no notes had been added to my account so I had to re-explain my situation all over again. At least this representative attempted to locate the package to request the drive stop the return--a step in the right direction. Though unsuccessful, he did try to better explain to me why I was no longer going to receive the rewards & a samples I had hand picked. While we decided on picking out new options instead, this "beauty advisor" could not pronounce or explain a single one of my options. He could not explain or remotely describe the items I was supposed to be picking from.I finally agreed to a couple items, I truly had no idea what was picked because my beauty advisor could not tell me. When he couldn't add them to my cart for whatever reason, he told me I would need to wait until his supervisor could help... Which was perfectly fine... Until he said he had no idea when that would be because he doesn't see anybody nearby. And that I might be better off keeping the points and saving them for next time. We'd been on the phone 40 minutes at this point, so I agreed and was provided a new order with fewer and/or completely different products than I originally ordered. After all this, I'm honestly still not completely sure I understand why.How does a multi-million dollar company decide to hire this level of customer service? How does any company for that matter, regardless of net worth, allow that embarrassing level of customer service to take place on their dime? I am absolutely ashamed of the way my calls were handled. Never once have I written a negative review, but I couldn't quite get this out of my head, even after taking several days to sleep on it. Please Sephora, for the sake of the customers that would like to return but are now looking to buy elsewhere, you must address your customer service standards.

Comment: I ordered this curling iron and blow dryer for the holidays and of course it will not be here in time. The correct company answer should have been to send out a Dry Bar blowout bundle to me, and do their own internal investigation. The bundle set I ordered is not cheap and I have been a customer of theirs for years. I should not be inconvenienced because of sloppy employee work or dishonest employees. Not at all happy with Sephora.

Comment: About 20 minutes later I called Sephora customer service only to learn that they NEVER update or cancel orders. What kind of customer service is that? I had placed my order less than an hour before calling, and my update wouldn't have affected my order at all, only how much my credit card was charged. At first they said my only option was to place a whole new order and then ship back the first order once I received it (which is really inconvenient). It was only after stating how upset I was with the company that they said they would look into the possibility of MAYBE canceling my order. I was really shocked and disappointed by their policy, especially considering that I'm a VIB client, which means that I spend hundreds of dollars with them every year. I truly can't wrap my head around their total disregard for customer satisfaction.In addition, earlier this year I had a negative experience with their in-store customer service. The beauty adviser I was matched with to give me recommendations on a number of products I needed had very little knowledge of the products in the store and was not helpful in the slightest. I was also supposed to receive a complimentary makeover, but was rudely ignored. I'm almost at the breaking point of just trying to order all my beauty products on Amazon, which I regard as a much more customer-friendly company. They at least let you cancel an order before it gets shipped.

Comment: Last Sunday for the VIB Rouge 20% off sale I attempted to use my gift card for some items. The gift card showed as $73.83 and my remaining balance was $8.77 that came out of my PayPal debit card. Upon checking out I hit 'PLACE ORDER' and I received red lettering that told me the order could not be processed because an item I had in my cart was now out of stock. I was ok with it, so I went back to order something else...however, when I tried to use the gift card for an item that was in stock, it told me I had zero on the card. I then get an email from PayPal telling me Sephora changed me the remaining $8.77 so I thought the order went through after all. So I call to be sure and the rep tells me it was a mistake and that it will take 1-7 days for the money to go back on my gift card or for my PayPal to be credited. I was upset because the sale ended the next day. Later that night the rep called me back to tell me that her supervisor was going to take care of it and I would have my money back within 24 hrs. It has been a week and NOTHING. I see that the 8.77 they took out for the remaining balance has expired in PayPal but my gift card is still at ZERO. So, I call today to find out that now they are saying I never had money on that gift card. Of course I am pissed so now I had to call the store that issued the card and ask them for that receipt. They have to contact their audit department to get it and someone will call me back!! I am so over it with Sephora. They pack products TERRIBLY and ship them only to lose money because the items come damaged and they have to send out another. And that has happened too many times to count & Now this? Horrible customer service, and it is a shame.

Comment: I got to the counter to start the exchange process when the associate at the counter rudely told me "You might be given the lowest price for the exchange. That's just the way it is." I told her that I have heard no such thing before nor is that legal simply because I did not have a receipt. After questioning her about this, she then told me "well that's just the way it is. I'm telling you."I then gave her my credit card to pay for the difference and something had happened on the screen, I think, but she made me stand there and wait without even saying what was going on. I had been in line for about 30 minutes without a word on what was happening. I then said to her that I had to go to work just like she did and that she wasn't the only one that had work today.Finally, with my receipt came an advisory saying I was banned from returning any further items for a period of 180 days because of suspected fraud. First of all I am a regular Sephora customer. I shop at Sephora almost every month. I do throw my receipts away sometimes but I return products that do not work out for me. Not everyone can just throw things away that don't work for them.Secondly if this is Sephora's policy of taking returned items back for a lower price, they need to indicate that on their website. People need to be aware of such policy before bringing back items without a receipt. Not everyone is going to commit fraud by returning items without a receipt. They also need to improve customer service training and retrain employees on how to treat people better and not treat them like a criminal and make it so difficult for them to return something they did not particularly care for. It's a beauty store, different things work for different people.

Comment: As a goodwill gesture, I offered a solution for a credit note for the Melbourne, Australia store for the amount of the double-charge, but this was also declined. Good to know how "important" this company views their customers! I will definitely never shop at this store again anywhere in the world and I would encourage others to do the same. You will be treated like a number and completely ignored if you have any complaints or follow-up queries. Very disappointed!

Comment: I quickly called Sephora and the first person I spoke to basically yelled at me and told me, "Oh you get the money back in 8 days, it's the banks problem". I called my bank and they said it was actually Sephora's issue. I called Sephora back and the put in a complaint and the girl told me I'd have my money back in 3 days. It's been 8 days so I called again. I was told, "Oh actually you live in Canada it'll be 14 business days, you were given the wrong info. For your trouble we can give you 100 points". To be honest I laughed at this. This has been quite the stress for me and I plan to never shop here again honestly. What I do ask is for them to fix their website. The thing I don't understand is how you get charged anyways when it can't simply block the charge and say the info is incorrect before proceeding like every other website. But to be charged twice with no product, having to wait two weeks for a refund (on their mistake by the way) and only offered 100 points. Fix your website Sephora. I read online this has happened to many people. Not all of us are wealthy and have money to throw down the drain. I was of course happy to buy the product once and receive it! Not to be charged twice for nothing and dealing with the headache. Honestly good riddance.

Comment: I then asked if there was someone else I may speak to. One girl walked off a this point and the other (Nicole on her name tag. The only thing there.) Said she was. I knew immediately that this wasn't going to go far so I asked if she was the store manager or assistant manager. She was an assistant manager so I asked to speak to the store manager who was not available. This person Mark ** is apparently never available and does not respond to emails. I returned to the store recently and asked if he was there physically once again he was not. I expressed my concern with a cast member and they suggested I get a hold of a Brian ** the district manager. Neither individual has attempted to make contact with me.Oh wait there is more... my last visit to the store location in hope that I might catch the evasive Mark ** at work. While waiting for him, apparently he was there, but had dipped out for lunch (later discovery) I overheard the 2 very same employees mentioned before discussing ** and how you couldn't tell if they were going to buy make up or blow you up. I left. After all how much can a person take. I already felt short of calling my wife the "N" word (we are **) I was already offended from the related encounter, and to hear further racial commentary propagated by a company employee that holds itself to a "higher standard" was just over the top. After all according to the Sephora employee employment page "YOU ARE THE FACE OF SEPHORA". A side note. After the first related incident I followed up with documentation and I even recorded video with audio every time I went back into the store attempting to meet with Mr. **. I have the ** comment on video with audio and both individuals in frame during discussion. I have offered to share this with Sephora... still no word. If I could post it here I would do so for your viewing pleasure or displeasure. I suppose that the lack of response by Sephora and its management proves that beauty is truly only skin deep and therefore shallow.

Comment: I was furious when I saw that message, so the first thing I did was go onto Google and see if anybody else has encountered this problem. It turns out TONS of customers encounter this problem. I saw that a few of them had their orders cancelled because the billing and shipping addresses were different from each other. My billing and shipping addresses are different, so this might be why they chose to cancel my order.Since Sephora refuses to do business with me I just went directly to the seller's websites (UrbanDecay, BareMinerals, etc) and bought my products there. Today I looked at my bank account charges and I found that Sephora still hasn't removed the charge for $57. It has been 3 business days. I read that it can take up to 7 business days to get a refund, so I will wait and see if they can give me my money back in a timely manner. So I will never shop Sephora online again. I have had a very bad shopping experience that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I will most likely find a different makeup store to shop at once I move back to civilization.

He said he will send it to his supervisor and I will have my money put back in my account within 24 hrs. Seeing as to how I can't get a straight answer - I call back a third time to confirm that my money which was held, without ANY NOTIFICATION TO ME, will definitely be returned tomorrow. This one told me it takes three business days!!! YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME SEPHORA!!! I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere after this experience and after seeing what other customers have had to go through.

Comment: Yes I spent a lot of money, but many of these items were directly purchased for my sister (before she opened her own account) and as gifts for others. Yes I returned around 25% of what I had purchased, but kept 75% and was under the impression I was not going against any rules or policies. Besides, I was told on the phone that I'm allowed to place multiple orders, return lightly used items, and place more than one order in a day. Here are the 4 reasons Sephora gave for banning me, INSTEAD OF politely asking me to improve my shopping habits to their standards: 1) "Oh, it's your address... it's the same as your sister's. We have a policy against 2 people in one house, so change one of your addresses and problem will be fixed." Address changed. Problem not fixed. 2) Three days later (after another cancelled order): "Oh, it's because your last name is not on your shipping address. We updated it and you can go ahead and order now." Placed orders... NOT fixed. Same result of order being cancelled. 3) Two days after that: "Oh, it's because you need to go into a Sephora store to prove your identity with ID and show proof of address." Done. Took a 1.5-hour bus ride on my day off to do this! Still, they cancelled my orders afterwards. 4) Two more days later: "Oh, it's because the manager in the store didn't type your name into the computer to update your account. Go back and get her to input data because it has to be changed at store-level." Done. And still have cancelled orders two days later after that!When I phoned back a 5th time, which was 9 days after the first cancelled order, I was told that there's a note on my account saying they are not allowed to talk to me and that I have to wait for the investigation team to finish their investigation. But... I'm welcome to shop in the store. Hahahaha... there's no way I'll be giving them any more $ unless this issue is resolved and an apology given. I was VERY polite with them on the phone and each time simply asked one question: "Why?" And now I'm sitting here looking up forums like these to see if this has happened to anyone else. This is real and it's extremely unfair of Sephora. If I've abused my privileges without knowing, they should say so. Please take note if you hit VIB rouge. This happened the same week I reached that level. Good luck all! :)

Comment: This is so low-end that I will never buy anything in Sephora again. We don't need them in NYC. We have so many choices. When I have the time, I am writing to Sephora Corporate (CEO Calvin McDonald, Christie Jack- Sr.VP/Retail). In addition, my on-line order was stolen at the Sephora fulfillment center and some illegible signature was scribbled in. Sephora did re-send the products and admitted the problem was at their end. I could go on and on but in essence, who needs this? I'll shop elsewhere. They are a very poorly run, messed up company. They can stay in their own country and they wouldn't be missed at all.

Comment: Upon speaking with a rep, I was told the only thing they could offer me was 200 points added to my account. The discount I should have received was close to $30.00. I waited until the discount period to place the order. They know I am a VIB member and DESERVE the discount. But the best they can do is a lousy 200 points, which of course I cannot use until I place another order. I should have been offered a credit/gift card for the amount of the discount - a no brainer really. With so many other options out there, I am sad to see that Sephora does not value their loyal customers, something I have seen through reading the other reviews here. My instinct at this point is to just send back my order when it arrives. I was going to include a letter stating why, but I am thinking based on what I have read here, that Sephora will not even understand - or care - why I am unhappy. Which makes me wonder why they bother with the survey at the end of the customer service interaction. Just going through the motions, I guess. Time to check out Ulta.

Comment: Fatima says "I need your card". I gave her my shiny red VIB Rouge card. She eye rolls and processes my return, looking at me like I'm a real PITA to her. Then she rings everything up again, -15%, and says "credit card" to pay $176. Hands me my bag "here ya go". WHAT does it take to handle a store promotion right the FIRST time WHAT does it take to be treated politely? Ask me for my card please. Thank me for shopping there. Fatima - your attitude will not take you far in the world. And it'll take a lot to get me to go back to a Sephora in the future. Thank you for listening.

Comment: Based on the other recent reviews, I guess I should consider myself lucky because I actually received my purchase (an item exclusive to Sephora). But the nasty rep neglected my special code items and an email I wrote regarding this has never been answered. Is someone trying to run Sephora's business into the ground? They're behaving like it's their misguided anti-business goal. I for one have stopped ordering anything from Sephora because of their total lack of regard for the customer.

Comment: Sephora refuses to replace the lipstick. I just spent 50 minutes on the phone with Sephora's customer service line, most of that time on hold. I explained the problem, and I pointed out that I am one of their best customers and that this was the first time I was making any kind of request -- I have never before asked Sephora to give me anything or to do anything for me. They said "No", flat out. They pretended that they have no power to do anything for me, that I would have to go back to the store and take it up with the store.I am busy, with a full-time job, and the store is many miles away from where I live or work (I was there on the one Saturday I was free to go shopping; it is now Sunday and I am at my office, and I will be at work all next week). I do not have time to go back to the store over a $36 lipstick that a Sephora salesperson may have inadvertently forgotten to put in my bag (even though I -- of course -- paid for it).Sephora exemplifies corporate greed at its most gluttonous. Women collectively spend billions of dollars with this corporate behemoth. Their "rewards" program consists of awarding points that customers can then redeem for tiny product samples that undoubtedly come out of Sephora's marketing / advertising budget --i.e., calculated to get customers to spend even more money at Sephora rather than actually showing genuine appreciation for their patronage. The points can never be redeemed for products that a customer might actually voluntarily choose. Customers' patronage is never acknowledged in a truly meaningful way, say, for example, with any free product of one's choice under $100. And Sephora's products never, ever go on sale.Sephora's attitude of contempt for its customers is epitomized by its refusal to send me -- one of its most loyal and ridiculously high-spending customers -- a $36 lipstick to replace one that its own salesperson may have forgotten to put into my shopping bag, even though I paid for it. As a consumer and as a woman I am disgusted with Sephora's contempt for, and eagerness to exploit, me. Where possible, I am going to start buying my beauty products from other retailers.

Comment: I asked to speak to a supervisor, and couldn't because one was not there. I was assured that one would contact me. No one has. I have emailed, through the customer service account, on the website. I have not had a response. I have been purchasing items at Sephora for over 16 years. I have never had a problem. I have been a loyal customer. I will no longer purchase from Sephora.

Comment: Sephora, you can see I regularly shopped your store in review of my profile and VIP status and have never returned anything I purchased. I called the (800) number on the declination receipt and was advised they no longer accept returns without an original purchase receipt unless they can find it on my VIP account. Only then will they allow an exchange. I had a hard time conveying - gift - no receipt. The representative had no trouble conveying - too bad, not going to happen. Good grief - I vote with my dollar folks. I would think a very good way of destroying a business especially in today's competitive retail market would be to not stand behind what you sell, arbitrarily change your return policy (I looked it up on my phone, online as I was standing in the store) and then by all means inconvenience your customers in the process and demean them. I won't lend another dollar to support such bad business practice.

Comment: Prior to this, my shipping information was unavailable, saying that it had been delivered on 2/16 when I placed my order on 2/15. I had called their customer service number, waited on hold for 20-30 minutes, was hung up on, called again, waited another ten minutes, and was then berated by the customer service rep for approximately ten minutes as she proceeded to tell me that I knew nothing about the company, nothing about their shipping processes, and basically insulted my intelligence about the company. (I like to keep in mind that I make pretty frequent orders online and in store, possibly once a month, maybe more frequently than that.) She had hung up on me, providing me with nothing, and I emailed the company several times asking about shipping and why it said the product was delivered, explaining my experience with the customer service rep, etc. Today when I received my product, I saw that I did not have the foundation so I called again. I waited for twenty minutes on hold and when I finally spoke to someone, she had told me that there was nothing they could really do. They refunded me half of my purchase and told me that instead of them fixing their mistake, that I would have to buy the foundation without the set. The foundation itself is 42$ where the set is 46$ (beauty blender/foundation set). It was absolutely pointless and I have never been more frustrated by a company's ignorance and behavior. It genuinely makes me never want to shop at Sephora again, when I have always loved their products and have always loved the service I received in stores. I am to the point where I may never shop there again.

Comment: I ordered 252 worth of product recently and it was suppose to be delivered 2 business days. However, 10 days later and still awaiting my order. I emailed Sephora twice asking for a response regarding my concern on the shipping and did not receive an email back. I called the 877 number, and was informed by a rep NOT to email them because it never goes anywhere and to call Sephora directly, which I HAD to if I wanted any answers. My original concern pertained to shipping and how long it was taking, but after speaking to their representative about my order she stated that she would only able to give me "Beauty Points" and suggested I pick up my order at UPS if I couldn't wait until the delivery day. Cheap way to perform business I feel. Future purchases are best done at the store or Ulta.

Comment: Well the wait on hold was at least 15 minutes, AT LEAST. I finally get someone on the phone and I would say they were very awkward but that's IMO. I explained what the issue was and told them about how the website denied my card BUT still took $375 out of my bank account. How exactly is that possible? Anyways, I asked her if she could look up this order that was "denied" but I was still charged for and she is asking me things like "ma'am what all was in your shopping cart" and let's be honest I can't name every single thing off the bat and so I listed a few things and thought that would be enough to prove the authenticity of the order that I'm trying to make. Apparently she couldn't pull up this order and then asked how much was I charged.Not being near my computer because I get no cell signal in my downstairs apartment I just say what is was around. She still is saying she doesn't see what I'm talking about like I'm insane. So how is it that they can charge me but not pull up what they charged me for. I'm extremely frustrated and I will never shop online there again. And as for trying to get everything straightened out over the phone FORGET IT. Might as well not spend my money on a place that has no clue what they are doing and are zero help on the phone.

Comment: Judging from the reviews I have seen, I'm not holding my breath on getting a refund from them. I will most likely have to open a case with PayPal. Absolutely ridiculous! I will never, ever buy from Sephora again. I went to Amazon and reordered a different brand. I just can't believe they treat their customers this way. Do not purchase from Sephora online. YOU WILL GET NO SUPPORT WHAT SO EVER!!!

Comment: Back in August, I ordered a primer that they don't carry in the store, based on good reviews and the brand which is one I like. As it happens, it balled up and broke me out. Hence, I sent it back using Sephora's prepaid label and I can see via tracking that they received it in the middle of September. Well, it's almost December and I have yet to receive a refund. I have called and emailed numerous times about this and no one can give me an explanation! When I email, they tell me to call. When I call, they put me on hold and transfer me to another person who is also of no help. It was only $35 so I will take the loss on it but it gets worse...A week before Halloween, I ordered some makeup items for my daughter's costume and despite having access to free "2 day flash shipping" this order took almost a week to go out! Again, I had to call them and the rep kept telling me the items were on their way yet could give me no proof of tracking! When I finally got frustrated, she HUNG UP ON ME!!! I then called in and asked immediately to speak with a supervisor, who was much nicer but ultimately, couldn't give me much information. The package finally turned up... after Halloween.Most recently, I placed a large order to take advantage of the 20% off sale they have twice a year. Out of the 15 products I ordered, I wasn't fond of two of them so I very hesitantly sent them back. Thankfully (or so I thought) I received an email confirming that they were received and that I'd receive another email once they process the return. Well, it's been over a week and still no email. So I emailed them about this and received an email back stating that they cannot help me via email; I have to call in. Why have a customer service email address if you refuse to answer people? It's not as if I sent them an email lacking information or details. I provided very specific info in regard to my order and they took almost two days to tell me that!? Come on, that is completely unacceptable. Are the employees in their customer service department not trained at all? Do they just not care? I don't know but their whole way of conducting business is questionable and I refuse to put up with it any longer. These products equal more than $35 so I will be filing a dispute with my credit card company this time around and I encourage anyone dealing with a similar situation to do the same! Anyway, I called them today on my lunch break and wasn't able to stay on hold long enough to receive help (ha, not like I'd have been helped anyway) so I use that term very loosely. Frankly, I don't want to call them in the very little time I have after work with my children and my husband. They should be able to help me within the 45 minutes I spent on lunch not eating, but rather waiting on hold, or via email.Seriously people, nothing they sell is worth the aggravation and flat out abuse from their customer service department. Ulta and Macy's carry many of the same products and they've always managed to treat me like a human being and not steal my money when I returned something. They really need to be held accountable for this nonsense. It seems to happen rather frequently and personally, I'm done with it. They won't see another dime of money. They seem like they don't care, but once more customers start doing the same, it'll add up and they will.

Comment: I felt uncomfortable in that store and I felt I wasn't wanted there. Like they wanted me to shop like a hunter for a deer -- in and out. I decided on a night oil and as I was reading product info another clerk came and offered help. I repeated my story and felt I wasn't welcomed and although she was nicer than the other lady, she was also not knowledgeable and wanted me to decide to buy and get out. I finally settled for Dior, bought only the stuff I ran out of, got some makeup and left. Sephora was not interested in helping me learn more about products. They wanted to make some sale and get rid of me. I was there for about 25 min. Since Dior cost the same at Macy's which is next door, I will go there next time just because of such hostile customer service I encountered at Sephora.

Comment: It has been 42 days since I mailed the package and I still don't have my refund. 6 calls and 3 promises of a 24-48 processing time for the refund and nothing. I didn't even receive a confirmation email when they received and processed the return 10/23/2015. At one point I was told my refund was issued in the form of store credit because I had to specifically ask for it back on my card - which was a bold face lie. I have sent in email inquires that have not been responded to, and each time I call it takes 30+ minute (most of which I'm on hold) for them to "look into it". I am furious with this experience and have spent hours collectively dealing with this joke of a company. A word of advice - buy your beauty products elsewhere.

Comment: On this most recent trip I went to the store to get items that were sold out online and at the same time to return some items that had receipt and also no receipt. All of these items/brands are exclusive to Sephora Canada so it was evident I got them from Sephora because nowhere else sells them and those brands do not ship to Canada. Some of the items were brand new, untouched, and still sealed. Since I do not drive and have a busy schedule, I wanted to do everything in one trip. I had my items and printed the name of the items I wanted to return on paper with their item ID numbers in the hopes to assist the staff in quickly identifying the items and also brought my federal ID with me.They treated me like royalty when I was filling up my shopping bag but when I got to the cashier and mentioned that I had returns or exchanges, especially without receipt, they looked at me with dagger eyes and turned dead cold and straight up rude. This has been my Sephora experience/observation since I joined but it has gotten much worse. The male salesperson who was initially serving me at the cash register asked his supervisor to assist me to make it quicker, and he was very sarcastic and unhelpful. All the while they were whispering into their little headsets about me as if I am a criminal to be looked out for. I saw staff gathering, talking, and eyeing me. With that said I had already purchased thousands of dollars online at Sephora that very same day, and hundreds in that same store visit. Little did they know, or do I say, little do they care.The supervisor who took over informed me the return policy has changed in July, but how was I to know since my last trip was in March. No email was sent to inform customers about the change. She said she could only accept items found in my online history and said she only saw 1 item that was eligible even though I had brand new and sealed Sephora exclusive items right in front of her. When I went home, I looked at my online history and saw several other items that she "missed". Unbelievable is the word. I also have physical receipts from store purchases that were not recorded in my online history, so what is up with that? I have close to 8000 points, not counting points I have already redeemed for samples so where are all my history for those points? And why can't I use points for products I want instead of those samples that do nothing for me?These points come from spending money at Sephora over the years and clearly not from returning stuff or abusing any policy yet they treated me like I was a dishonest cheat and meant nothing to them as a customer, not appreciating or realizing that customers pay their salaries and their bills. To make things worse, the online orders I made were cancelled by Sephora several times due to slight differences in the order of my name and billing/shipping addresses. They did not inform me of the cancellations and I almost missed the promotion altogether and would not have been able to stock up. This repeated itself when I tried with a second card to make the same order. I have had no problems purchasing with my card but only at Sephora online did I have to jump through all these hoops going back and forth with my bank and Sephora itself.When the orders were cancelled, Sephora did not send any emails and they do not release the funds either so the credit cards were charged nonetheless, thereby reducing the available credit to purchase a new order. How seriously ridiculous. This whole gong show of ordering and cancelling took place for 4 days, not to mention going to the store and getting humiliated for no wrong I did. To top it off, I bought online via airmiles.ca to collect miles but because Sephora cancelled my orders, I had to replace those cancelled orders via the phone and all my potential miles are gone. So much for planning ahead and buying online at the strike of the midnight clock when the promotion was activated.High time another retailer brings in brands to Canada so that Sephora Canada wouldn't monopolize the market with marked up prices and abuse regular supporters of the brand. Some of their products have increased by $35 from the year before, thus the 20% discount is basically a write off for the mark up. 100% guaranteed poor customer service/appreciation at Sephora. But on the bright side, at least I am not working there.

The 1-800 number can't help me since this happened at retail but retail district or regional managers cannot be contacted. How can they not care about their customers? I spent $5,700.00 last year alone.I won't be using my 20% this year for the first time in a long, long time. At 60 years old I have learned one very important thing - "There's nothing I need that bad". I will be shopping elsewhere.

And of course, the moment I went and paid, the guy disappeared. This happened in Athens, Syntagma store in Greece. I thought I'd give Sephora a second chance and see what they can do about this.

Comment: I went back to the store to purchase the correct color. When I got to the register I told them it was a gift. The clerk was almost ballistic. She wanted my driver's license and said that I probably could not return it w/o receipt. She entered everything in the computer (remember this was an exact exchange) and out popped a receipt saying that I was banned from returning anything from Sephora with or without receipt for 365 days!!! I was with my DIL and granddaughter who looked at me in horror as the clerk implied I had been making fraudulent returns. There was a telephone # on the receipt to call if you wanted to know why you were a criminal. I am old and now I am so angry I could kill. I called the company and they told me to call Sephora. I called Sephora and after waiting for 45 minutes spoke to someone who knew nothing. She had never heard of such a thing.Asked to speak to Supervisor but after going back and forth with questions from so called Supervisor from her to me was told that Supervisor would call me back. I cannot keep going with this complaint but long story short there is a company called "The Retail Equation" that tracks your transactions and decides if you are a criminal or not. I order my return report from them and I had only returned 2 single items since 2012. This qualified me as a criminal!!! I have emailed Sephora 4 times for an answer and just get return emails, a week later, stating their return policy without any mention of what to do if you do not have a receipt. I give up, I am going to die with this criminal record. However, I plan on telling everyone I know about how they can expect to be treated when they go to return something that they have received as a gift from Sephora.

Comment: Then they came up with a solution, which was opening a dispute through my bank. I asked the representative "So once I submitted the dispute and get the approval, I can get my refund back right?" The representative answered "Yes, I will put a note on your order to make sure, so once you submitted your dispute, you will get all your refund back." And now is the end of May. I received a letter from my bank stating that my dispute was denied and the reason was "the merchant has informed us that the merchandise has been delivered." So I called them back and the customer service told me that since this case is close, there's nothing they can do and suggested me to contact my bank about this. This is ridiculous. If I already knew you will deny my request, what's the point to contact my bank? Worst online shopping experience ever. I definitely will not order from Sephora anymore. SHAME ON YOU.

Comment: She was was saying things like "You didn't get this here because I can't find the transaction." I assured her and showed her on my Sephora page that it had been purchased from her store. She said she had to give me a store credit for 2 things, but was able to return the one which I had the receipt. When she handed me the return receipt, she threw it down on my hand very forcefully. I had NEVER been treated so rudely before from Sephora, which is very disappointing. She had a few other coworkers help her with the return and they never smiled or said hello and when I was trying to explain something, they would ignore me and talk to each other.They were treating me as it was a huge inconvenience for them and I apologized but then realized that "I am the customer" and that it is not my fault because I was told I could have a hassle free return. I left the store extremely upset and almost in tears and told my mother and sister in law what a horrible experience I had just had. It ruined my day and I will definitely tell everyone I know how horribly I was treated.

Comment: Well Sephora.com just INSISTS I live in Murray when I do not...... and of course as a result, it caused my billing information not to match the shipping address. My address is correct on my end, not correct on Sephora's. I try to edit the information because after the first decline, it doesn't say on the site that there was a billing info problem, it just said my card was declined. I kept checking my balances and the money was in the account, so I attempted twice more. Big mistake.The total amount of the order $145.32 was placed on hold three times in my account for a total of 435.96! I called Sephora Customer service 4/3 and all they can say is I have to wait 1-7 Business days. Well its 4/13 and I have been patient, but the funds are still on hold. Why can't you guys just let people enter in their matching information. I call my bank and the funds won't be back till tomorrow, in total about 11 days of utter nonsense because Sephora has to be contrary. Auto correcting my address does nothing to help me or you. I guess Sephora is into losing $150.00+sales on a regular basis. I will probably be buying my cologne from Ulta from now on. Less headache and nicer staff anyway. How does Sephora stay in business will all the sales they reject online and in the stores?

Comment: I contacted customer service and spent over 30 minutes on hold and speaking with two people with the same refrain - "there is nothing we can do, it needs to be redeemed at a freestanding Sephora store." One of the persons told me to use while on vacation. I feel like they highly misrepresented this product and the company. It should not be sold online if it cannot be redeemed online and there should be a better warning that the company does not back up or support its products company-wide. I have looked at many sites about the company and I will no longer support them with my purchasing money.

Comment: I just ordered some more stuff online with Sephora, so I am hoping all goes well with that. I am reading horror stories with online orders. Yikes! I am determined to get my skin back to fresh and glowing like it was pre pregnancy. It's only been a few days, but just my skin tone and feel has already massively improved. ** is the best and knows what she is doing!!!

Comment: I called Discover and they told me Sephora didn’t try to post the refund for that transaction. I opened a dispute for that charge and weeks later Sephora fought back and my dispute was rejected. After back and forth with Discover card my case has been reopened and I am still awaiting for the final decision. This is actually a second time where Sephora toyed with me with my online return. First time which was about 2 years ago they “forgot” for 3 months to refund me for an online purchase. I had to call them to remind them to get my money back.

Comment: Well back to this recent order from 1-11, I ordered 3 items, thought they were all in stock as the website did not state otherwise, and after I placed the order I received a confirmation email. Well today, 1-15-19, received an email saying one of the items has been cancelled because it's not in stock!!! Shocker! The other two items, plus my free samples plus the items I chose by using my points have all shipped and I've received a tracking #. I can't wait to see if they screw this one up too. I hope I get the samples I picked and I hope I get the other items I chose from using my points. That's the only reason I shop at Sephora, because of the points and free samples. But Sephora ONLINE, you are bombing it right now. If someone like myself takes time to write a review you better believe I am aggravated as heck.It's a respect issue for me. Sephora do you respect and care about your customers? BTW I shop online because I don't like the whole in store "sales" experience. All they are trying to do is get their numbers (sales) up. They look at you and all they see are dollar signs. So I'm comfortable shopping online. What are YOU going to do about this?

Comment: Beware of the delay shipments and don’t assume it will come on time as they claim especially if you need the package in a rush and I don’t recommend paying for the flash shipping. You can get free 2 day shipping if you purchase over $50. It’s a rip off and the gimmick is to get you to shop regularly and spend all your money at Sephora. You can find deals just about anywhere online if you spend the time to research. Ulta and Macy’s often have better deals just on the common brands. Also, I have to mention the free samples are always wrong. They just send whatever they want or have. I don’t understand what is the point to let you choose if they will send you different than what you requested. It’s like hauling trash home.

Comment: After 10 phone calls about this and six e-mails, no one can figure out how to process the return, even though they know I did nothing wrong. They told me to just do a VISA dispute, but they are unwilling to confirm that this has happened via e-mail. VISA only wants the documentation via e-mail (they won't do the conference call the manager of Sephora suggested). So Sephora just stole $54 from me.

Comment: The ONLY bad thing I have to say is about the free samples. For one, they used to give 3 samples and NOT ONCE out of 1,000 orders have I actually received the free samples that I selected in my order. That is awful as I sometimes make a purchase JUST to get the samples I order. If they cannot give you the sample you actually order online, then don't allow the option to select. It is extremely frustrating. Then I end up having to go on eBay and BUY my sample anyway. They always advertise new perfumes as a free sample, but never have I ever received any of these new perfume samples ordered. Instead, I get three postcards with a dash of makeup primer by benefit. Those went right in the trash.Other than the clear problem they have with filling orders properly, (free sample mass confusion), it is a great experience. I shop at Sephora more than ANY store. There is just never a time when you have enough makeup and/or skincare products. Just when you think you are "good" a new invaluable product is released. Sephora is always the first to get new releases. VERY happy with Sephora.

Comment: In the meantime, I contact Sephora via Twitter and they said they can't do anything about in-store transactions even after I supply proof i.e. partial bank statement and receipt. Sephora via email said the same thing. That brings me to 3 phone reps, 2 email reps and a Twitter rep who all can't or won't help me because they're adamant I got my refund or they just can't. I've spent a lot of money with them and been a customer for many years. This month alone I spent $300. They're too big to care about one person but I refuse to shop with them anymore. I "cashed" in my 1000 points for a reward today and I'm done.

Comment: After 13 days of return, I still don't know if they received my return or not. I had another order received earlier in the month, I decided to return for it was not what I wanted, 100% unopen & unused. So I decided to use the prepaid label 'hassle-free' and 'easiest' way to return it. WRONG WRONG guys, after it was picked up by my local agent of USPS, the tracking info IS GONE FOR GOOD. And the only other tracking # on the smart shipping label Sephora uniquely has, is not valid for me to track at all on the USPS website. In another word, you will be blindly waiting for your refund and notice after you delivered it to USPS shipping office. The Smart shipping label they have - provide no information on where it is shipping to, the shipping method (2 days/ ground), so you will have no idea at all on the status. Contacted the customer services, they said please allow 3 weeks to process, ehhhh, how about an update please? Like is the shipment lost or not or received? Next time, I will definitely pass on the online shopping experience at Sephora, it is too much for my nerves when I cannot get a hold on when to expect what.

Comment: I asked if they could send them out to me since they were forgotten and she said “We can’t send out free samples by themselves; they must be included with an order”. I told her I would not order any products online through them again since the products I ordered are not guaranteed. She said they are guaranteed. I responded by saying they are not guaranteed because if they were I would have received it. I told her I have lost trust in their company and refuse to order online from them again. I’m disappointed that I did not receive the samples but I am extremely frustrated with their poor customer service. When I had asked for a manager, the associate told me she would say the same thing.

Comment: Since Sephora only attempts delivery once and needs signature, I will definitely not receive the order and they refuse to cancel it. Also stop using couriers please Sephora. They are horrible. I will never shop here again. I have already spent 100s at Sephora and would definitely be 1000s in the future because I love buying brand name makeup. I already have several Marc Jacobs products, a few Benefit, Kat Von D, Cover Fix, Zoeva, etc. All bought this year since I discovered Sephora. But Sephora is off the list now. I will shop directly at the brand or at Mecca or other department stores in my country. Never again Sephora. I gave you a chance to fix the situation but you refused. Now better companies will get my money.

Comment: Another customer walks in (a former employee) and EVERY woman in the store ignored customers including myself to stop and talk to her. Ask her if she was applying for seasonal help. Then the lady helping me told me about a product I may like after some chit chat. She was fake polite, but took her attention away from me to ask someone through the mirror if she made a sale off the previous customer. Then told me, "I apologize we are not disorganized like this." She then asked the makeup consultant if she would assist me. The makeup consultant came over, I told her what I was looking for and she told me to look online for the product because she does not have my skin tone. Then she ran back over to the former employee, sat her down and started a full makeover on her. You know this area is known to be high class and customer service is expected with that. My visit was horrible, I did not get recommendation, or products that I needed. Five days later I am contacted by Aimee ** Talent Business Operations Manager, who works at the store. So, I waited for a month and a half for a response from the District Manager. I have been in contact with Sephora customer service via email, who are now refusing to have the district manager contact me after asking me to wait 7 business days. I have contacted today, and I am now being told rudely four times by customer service to call so my issue can be addressed. Let me tell you this, the other locations I have been to in the last 5 states I have lived in, I have never had a problem with. The stores in the Memphis area have a reputation for snotty associates which I have found out for myself. This location is the lesser of the snotty stores from what I have been told. Now, I am two months out on horrible customer service, and now having to pull myself away from my life to make a complaint via Consumer Affairs because you cannot hire customer service or associates to do their job.

Comment: Well I have a pretty good idea why - with the in store only redeemable point scam, Sephora gains not only an additional full size product purchase with each redemption, but also avoids having to give the 3 free samples for all said purchases. And what does the customer gain? NOTHING! Nothing but having to spend more money for points they’ve been “gifted” along with the play box subscription that they have ALREADY PAID FOR! Not acceptable! Ulta is looking better & better these days!

Comment: I then called Customer Service, the agent said that my order has not been shipped at the time, yet I'm literally telling him my shipment ID number that can only be found in the packing slip. Why would a customer lie about receiving a package? He then tells me to wait and to call back. I went back and forth with Sephora about 6 times trying to get my items. Fast forward to August 14th, I get a notification that my order has shipped from Sephora online, but when I go to click on the tracking link it takes me to the same package that was grossly missing items. I then called Sephora Customer Service again raising all chaos. I paid with a Sephora Gift card that I received as a graduation gift from college. If I paid with a debit card I would have disputed the charge with my bank a long time ago. Sephora finally reordered my items free of charge for me through the phone to which I finally received it August 20th. What a darn shame, I had to wait a whole 11 days to get my complete order. I'm an avid online shopper that has never dealt with such abysmal customer service and empty packages. What is going on in the warehouses? Are the workers stealing the items? It makes no sense. Long story short, I will never purchase from Sephora ever again, not even in the flesh.

If I paid with a debit card I would have disputed the charge with my bank a long time ago. Sephora finally reordered my items free of charge for me through the phone to which I finally received it August 20th. What a darn shame, I had to wait a whole 11 days to get my complete order. I'm an avid online shopper that has never dealt with such abysmal customer service and empty packages. What is going on in the warehouses? Are the workers stealing the items? It makes no sense. Long story short, I will never purchase from Sephora ever again, not even in the flesh.

Comment: Trying to use the Sephora gift card online through the JCPenney app it was going to let me use it there except for JCPenney tells me that I have free shipping due to the amount spent but then will not let the order go through without me paying shipping and handling and does not give me the option to ship to store. This policy needs to be changed and the Sephora gift cards need to be able to be used at any Sephora no matter if they're purchased at the store online, at a JCPenney or any other store that Sephora might be in.

Comment: However, second time today, I did not get the item I want with the promo code used, AND instead of receiving 3 of the samples I have chosen, the packer just threw in 1 perfume sample. What happened to my promo code item? And the reason why I made those orders was because there are some samples I really wanted to try before purchasing a bigger size. What is the point of letting us choose the samples we want if Sephora is just going to throw in whatever they want? Understand samples do run out, and if it is really the case which I don't think is my case, so why didn't Sephora just update their samples page?Have read so many disappointing reviews on Sephora before I decided to write this today. And they are ALL same issues. Samples missing, Promo code item missing, lousy packing etc. Yes, I too received all items in boxes that are way too big with just a brown paper thrown in the box. Except for one order from Chelsea Rd Aberdeen MD, my item is bubble wrapped (thank you). Sephora you need to fix this issue before you start losing more customers. I don't think I will purchase anything online from Sephora again after I experienced excellent customer service from Beautylish this trip.

Comment: Another time I had placed an order (within the last 5 months), they shipped it to the wrong address. An address I lived at 3 years ago and was nowhere to be seen on my Sephora profile. How this happened, I have no idea and customer services also had no idea how this happened. Customer service have always been 'nice' for the most part, but they are very ineffectual. They offer to give points and that's all they really do. When I told them how incredibly disappointed I was in the downhill service with shipping, he told me that 'UPS is an amazing service'. I have a hard time believing that it's only UPS making all of these errors and think that Sephora has some culpability here.

Comment: Another week went by, no refund. Just called today, and the associate put me on hold a couple times, then came back and said the refund had been processed. “I should see the refund within 5 days.” I’m not sure what the issue was; if my return had been delayed via mail, if the return department was backlogged/busy, if my return just sort of slipped through the cracks - since no one in Sephora support mentioned anything, I can only assume that it was just incompetence in this instance, but in all my years of online shopping and the occasional mail-in return, I have never had anything like this happen. It seemed like my refund was only processed because I called about it TWICE. The first support associate didn’t mention if the return had been received late, if they hadn’t received it yet, or if it had just been received recently and the refund hadn’t yet been processed; she just said that it would be processed the following week or so. Anyway, very disappointed in the way this return/refund was handled.

Comment: When I asked who the third party was, what information they will be collecting and the purpose I was told she had no clue. Further, I was told that once I provide my passport, etc. there isn't a guarantee that they will allow me to exchange the item. I asked what they do with customer passports and driver licenses after the "check" is completed, where is the information stored? She again had no answers. THIS IS A HUGE SECURITY ISSUE!!! All this to return a $30 item for which I had an email receipt from their website. It is very POOR customer service. I will never purchase from them again.

You'll get a confirmation email in a day or so." 4 days later I get an email saying my order has already been shipped (shipped 2 days after I canceled the order) and that they were unable to cancel my order... SERIOUSLY??? So annoying, so moral of the story if you like your items to be delivered in a timely matter and enjoy receiving good customer service then you DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO ORDER FROM SEPHORA.

Comment: I went to a store in Boston and got makeup on my coat and it was so disorganized. I was told I would hear from the manager and tried to call back - but of course no one gave me a response. I went to the Cambridge store and was told straight out that something that would not look good on me wasn't in stock and then it was less than 24 hours later. You can't tell me they didn't have that in the back ready! Some places did already. The mail service is the worst. I got sent some old cleanser (verified the code) and some dried out lip gloss. This cleanser company HAS had old makeup on the shelves of Sephora before and no, they don't care, just push off the old product to customers. As long as they get their money too! Had to try to return it - told a credit would come right back to my bank account. Been 2 weeks now and have not seen!PayPal says I can't prove I sent it back when I CLEARLY had all the info so I might lose about 80.00 because of this horrible, unprofessional store as a whole. PayPal is also part of the problem because I showed them that I sent back it and the overseas people who work at PayPal do not understand how the USPS tracking works. The local stores are bad - the online is just as bad. A Reddit account posting says they deliberately don't refund quickly in case you have remorse and have to pay your bills instead because their makeup is so pricey. I say who cares, the store should refund the money in a timely manner, I'm reading on here sometimes they lie and say they don't refund it at all! I think they should be going above and beyond for customers. Especially because the stuff is so expensive. Or in my case, old, smelly, and defective.

When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told I would have to hang up, call again, hold for someone, etc. This is unacceptable and I wanted to share my experience. Thank you.

Comment: I was so shocked and wanted to tell corporate, I called and they told me that someone would contact me, on 1/29/2018 Valarie emailed me and asked me to call her that she would be at the store all day until 4:00pm. So I did and was put on hold for 8 minutes only for Alice to pick up the phone and tell me that Valarie was not at the store! That Sephora is not what it used to be, I guess I will have to shop for Kat Von D on her official site. I couldn't find Stila in the store and I couldn't ask Stacey because she had checks to validate and couldn't even answer a simple question.

Comment: We decided to leave because of how rude she was and as we were walking out, we heard Donna talking about the “two annoying girls” who wanted facials. We heard her say to a coworker “they don’t know what they are doing” and that we “have no place here”. To top it off, as we left the store and said “bye thank you” to be courteous, she mimicked us in a childish tone. She finished her remarks with “maybe next time you can try buying something”. Maybe it was just Donna, but I have also had similar experiences here at the Northpark Sephora. The customer service is lacking and I am yet to be back. I could have been a lifetime customer but Donna killed that potential revenue stream.

You entice customers to make a purchase in order to get 3 free samples and then say you don't have to send them?" I would like to note that I am a VIP customer and spend a lot of money on their products but after this conversation, I'll take my business elsewhere.

Comment: I told him I found it difficult to believe that Sephora would only allow one account per household. That it made no business sense and or just common sense either. He then started rambling on about how he wasn't trying to say my intelligence was sub par but that's how Sephora rules were. I explained again how I had purchased the items and used my card and checked out but he kept going back to the account with my husband's name on it. Well I became very annoyed and just hung up on him. I will wait and try to talk to someone who hopefully has better customer service skills. Also, after this order is corrected I will no longer be making any purchases from Sephora. I guess they do not value their customers and make you go through unusual hoops to correct their mistake(s). End of rant!

Comment: Once I realized It was the wrong item I contacted customer service and they were extremely rude and nasty. They informed me that there is nothing they can do, but to turn in the product and I should receive a refund. They also informed me that although the order filler at Sephora packed the wrong order that there wasn’t anything they can do because the product is now out of stock. This was a huge disappointment considering the fact that I‎t was in stock at the time of purchase. The customer service team was very unhelpful and rude to say the least. I will no longer be shopping at Sephora and will stick to Ulta or department stores.

Comment: I always shop in Ulta now, but because they don't carry Marc Jacobs I had to buy from Sephora again using my $20 off since I'm still a VIB this year. When my order arrived, all the samples were missing. I know that it's free but for your customer service to rub it in my face?? I emailed them what happened and I got something along the lines of "while it's nice to have freebies there's nothing we can do, now here's more points!" Are you serious?! They seem to be offering points to rectify everything and make irate customers go away. Now after reading most reviews, they seem to be not sending samples at all. Well how about please dont offer something you cant deliver.

Comment: I went back on Friday afternoon to purchase my products and they said, “we’re sorry but we thought you weren’t going to come back and we’ve already put the merchandise back on the shelves.” Are you kidding me??? It’s still within the 48 hours and no one even called me to find out whether I was coming back. I spend a lot of money at this store every month and all they could say is “sorry.” To make matters worse, several of the items I had on hold were gone from the shelves so I couldn’t purchase them for my daughter for Christmas. I did buy some items which I previously had on hold, but most were gone. I ended up buying $228.90 worth of products with nothing but “sorry.” I think their customer service and/or management is severely lacking. I believe they could have done something to make this awful experience better for me to ensure I would remain a loyal customer.

Comment: If the company is only going to give you whatever they might as well not let you select what items you prefer or correspond with you to make sure before they send out product that you will use it instead of wasting it. Honestly I'm more upset that Sephora isn't a company that is about its word, don't say or offer something that you're not going to actually do. Guess it's time to see what other beauty stores have to offer. However I did get the correct items I paid for so I'm happy about that, the package wasn't damaged and came earlier than estimated.

Comment: I am infuriated first that they couldn't process this in person because I used PayPal, and finally because of the poor customer service. I think it is poor service to make someone leave a store with a product that they are trying to return - and ask them to use another measure to get their money back. Terrible - especially for someone who spends so much money in that store.

Comment: For instance, they are currently advertising a "free sample bag with any order" of $35 and up, and list five different versions of the bag. I liked the bags so I ordered some makeup earlier than I usually would have, just to take advantage of the offer. Within 5 minutes of my order being placed, I was sent an email saying the sample bag was "canceled" because it was out of stock. Okay, well I'll get one of the bags still in stock, right? Nope. I was told over the phone that they won't substitute something else for the offer automatically, and after just a couple of minutes all orders will be "in progress" and it's "impossible" to make any change at that point. Yet that sample bag is still on their front page being used to get people to order, thinking they'll get this offer with their purchase! Sephora KNOWS it is out of stock. It's bait & switch and I'm DONE with it. It didn't used to be this bad; until about two years ago you could count on getting all your samples or a nice substitution if it ran out. Now Sephora refuses to honor their offers, and I suspect they never had any intention of doing so.

Comment: Needless to say, I am curious as to how they were able to establish this link. As further proof, they stated they were able to establish a link between me and the shipping destination. Again, I must question their link finding abilities because the product was shipped to Atlanta, Georgia and I have never lived, worked, visited, laid a fingernail in Atlanta, Georgia or any part of Georgia, for that matter. I don’t know if Sephora mishandles customer information in general or if they were outright lying to get out of reversing the charges, but I submitted a complaint to the California Attorney General detailing the inaccuracies contained in their statement. I suggest if anyone else has information about Sephora mishandling sensitive customer information, contact the California Attorney General. Hopefully, if they get enough complaints, they will investigate.

Comment: Recently, I have been having issues where orders I place are pending for days, and then eventually result in an "Unsuccessful Authorization." I have tried with multiple cards, entering my address in different ways, etc., but was still having the same problem. They never responded to the message I sent through their online contact form, and the 4-5 people I've talked to on the phone in the last 2-3 weeks have all given me conflicting information and have routinely told me things that were clearly just lies. For example, one representative told me that they had no way to know why the order was not going through, but another told me that it was definitely because my apartment number was listed on a different line on my billing address (even though I have placed orders like that in the past and it was fine).One representative told me it was because I tried to ship one of the orders to my mom, and another told me where I am shipping it wouldn't matter at all. Two of the representatives said that they would place a note in my account to make sure my orders would not keep getting cancelled in the future, since there is no apparent problem with my card, address, or account - however, the last person I talked to said there were no such notes. I had one representative manually place an order for me over the phone, and they said that there would be no issues, and sure enough... This order did not go through either.The one time I have recently been able to get an order to process, it was a disaster. I had an order that was pending for over a week, and I was assured that it was "absolutely" not going to process and that I needed to re-place the order. I re-placed the order, and sure enough, both orders shipped. When I called to notify them to cancel the one (which they did) I was still charged twice. Then for some reason they only issued a partial refund! I was still charged over $100 dollars for items I never received.My most recent experience was the most frustrating though. The most recent person I talked to very rudely mansplained to me for over 30 minutes about how I can't place orders with other people's cards or ship to other addresses (even though other representatives have told me those things shouldn't matter, and I have placed other orders like that just fine in the past). This doesn't even make sense because the first time I had this ordering issue it was with my own card and shipping to my own address. Even after spending almost 45 minutes on the phone total, they still couldn't tell me why I am unable to place orders on my account.Their advice was to call and verify my orders with their customer service every time I place an online order from now on - even though I have already tried that and this has not been successful. Even if that did work, who has time for that?! No matter how many times I asked, they would not transfer me to a manager. I wish I could take back the hours of my life back that have been spent on the phone and checking orders for products that I can just buy at other places. Clearly Sephora does not respect my time or money.

Comment: So she left and came back and said, "You can't open a Bottle of makeup to use as a sample." And I told THE MANAGER if they kept the testers ready then no one would need to open a bottle. I don't know if this color still works. I need to test it. And we went back and forth arguing about it until she finally decided the customer was right and looked in the drawer and found a bottle, opened it and used as a tester!!! This happens every single time I go in there. After all that I saw they had the right sample in the wrong labeled slot.

Comment: Finally she offers to reship, but at this point I'm hesitant because if it happened once, it could happen again. I ask her if she can ship overseas? No. Can she provide signature delivery confirmation? No. Can she leave a note with the delivery co. and tell them to A) please leave package in the mailbox, because you know, we have one. B) Ask the delivery person to come into the apartment building, knock on the door and deliver it into the hands of my mother. Or just send it straight to the post office. All no. Because I live in France (yes there is a Sephora here) and they do not carry the same name brands, I gave in and said okay, just reship the package. At the last minute she then tells me that one of the items I ordered was no longer in stock. So after suggesting to me for over 20 minutes to get a re-delivery of the same package I now find out one item is missing. The whole process was just one big headache. I asked for a refund and asked for an email confirming the approval for the return and still nothing! All I can say is NEVER AGAIN! Sephora, work out your delivery service because for the amount of money I'm spending, this type of thing shouldn't be happening.

It's not worth the horrid pain and displeasure of eyebrow appearance. I am soon leaving on vacation and because of Cinthyia, I am not fully content with my appearance, and for all you ladies hopefully reading this, we all know how we feel about our brows. No one can mess with them, unless you know what the hell you are doing. I am extremely displeased at Sephora mainly because the service is revealed as a life changing experience for women looking for a nicer look. Boy, did I get swindled. Like aforementioned, when you see the benefit brow bar ANYWHERE, keep walking. Get them waxed or attempt to try threading! That's really worth the strong pain, but as we women know. Beauty hurts!

Comment: I called last week and they said they were all canceled and the funds would be put back. I asked to speak with the Fraud dept and I was told I couldn't. They said that the situation would be investigated. I asked her "What if this guy has your card and does this to you?"... Silence.. She finally said she didn't know if they would do anything about it. I've got 200.00 in bills waiting to get paid. Thank God my husband didn't mail them.It's been almost a week and nothing's been done. We just called. We got the same runaround. They said they could cancel the one that already shipped out, but not the other three because there was no tracking number. SERIOUSLY?!?!? They don't cancel before they get shipped? I've never heard of such a thing. The agent kept trying to drop it and leave it at that. Luckily my husband was home and had a deeper voice than I. He deals with Verizon customers every day and knew exactly how and what to say. We still only ended up with one of them being canceled and 150.00 still up in the air. They said to give it a week to 10 until they are shipped. I'm wondering if they will require me to return them. Short of going to that address and banging on their door, I have no way to get those 3 lipsticks.Beware of Sephora. I am so angry right now. I love shopping at Sephora and now I have to cancel my account. We have adults here, so I can give them my business instead... In store. I have NEVER experienced customer service like this. It's mind boggling. Now I get to wait another week to call them again. I'm off to call my credit card and phone and explain why this month's bills aren't getting paid. So much for my credit score.

Comment: Second - this morning I was placing items in my cart that I was thinking about purchasing due to the 15% off sale. While doing so - I noticed that the Sephora Play! was open for subscription. I proceeded to subscribe. I was notified when doing so that the items already in my cart would be saved and not charged with the order. I proceeded. I got to the confirmation screen and chose which card I wanted to use and was told I'd be charged $10.97 (some change - don't remember exactly). I clicked that I understood the terms of Sephora Play! and clicked "charge". I was taken to a confirmation page. In less than a minute I received an email confirmation on my order. The confirmation was for $138 and not the $10. The website DID NOT order the Sephora Play! - it ordered the other items that were in my cart that it said it would not charge. I only verified the $10 charge - nothing more. I had to wait for Sephora's phone hours to open. Once I did, I was told that they couldn't cancel the order until it shipped. Now - okay - I kind of get this. BUT - they charged $138 to my account. That's $128 more than what I authorized. Yes, I had the items in my cart - but I wasn't even given the option add the bonus items that you can get - and I always charge my Sephora orders on my Discover due to getting Cash Back. So now, I have to wait and see if the order will be canceled. The kicker - there is only a 50% chance that it will be canceled. If it's not, I have to wait for the order to arrive at my door and then I have to ship it back. So, my account is $138 less for however long this is going to take. Ugh...

Comment: So I waited another week still no package arrived. Then I decided to call the post to check on the status, I found out that the delivery driver has delivered my products at a "Safe Place"...? But I said "How can it be delivered at a Safe Place when you don't have my apartment number or street number??? And I did not Sign for it???" So the said I can dispute this and they will try to locate exactly what went wrong. Oh... & that the delivery person is away on sick leave??? STRANGE! I'm still waiting on a response. I have also emailed Sephora. Explain all of this and also not much is being done. Only a representative emailed me today. They she will check with Australia Post On the status! Still waiting, I just contacted PayPal & disputed this & hopefully I get a refund as I have buyer's protection. I guess I will just have to wait & see!

Comment: After explaining this to a second "customer service" representative, I was simply given a link that shows shipping times - still not rectifying the situation or doing anything to appease me as a customer who spends hundreds of dollars a month at this company. Regardless of what representatives have said, according to Sephora's shipping guidelines, my order should have shipped and it did not. But bear in mind, when you sign up for Flash, you're agreeing to terms and conditions that basically say this expedited shipping is never guaranteed, so therefore you're throwing your money away. I would have just gone into the store, but I like the free samples that I get when I order online. Now I'll be cutting my ties with Sephora and shopping directly with the cosmetics brands I use.

Comment: Once I got "help" I was told I needed to already know the brand and type of foundation I wanted because she could only try ONE on me. And I needed her why? I went there so they could help me with that. So I picked a brand and she determined my color undertone. She came back with something else (in a different tone because she knew the other would be too light). I was very specific nothing with pink or peachy tone, she paid no attention. To say she was disinterested/bored is an understatement. Their mirrors are all dark coated so you can't determine much yourself. She kept pushing additional products. I purchased the foundation and was furious when I looked in my car mirror and saw my rosy pink face. Went back in and returned it. Will never go back. They act as if they are doing you a favor by even minimally doing their job.

Comment: I've attended a few of their classes, where I was ignored, spoken to condescendingly, made to feel less valued than others, and assumed to know nothing about makeup when I'm very knowledgeable about it. I'm actually passionate about makeup, and have lots of the products Sephora sells. But shockingly, I'm assumed to know nothing about makeup. It's fine to order online, but the stores are extremely discriminatory, judgmental, hurtful, and unfair. They really love and appreciate some customers while degrading and rejecting others.It's a terrible place to shop if you're not **, fairly attractive, look very expensive, and have that clubby Sephora vibe. Extremely exclusionary place. Do not spend any of your money there! Boycott Sephora for their severe discrimination and overt racism. By the way - I live in one of the most "progressive" cities in America, one that prides itself on "diversity." For Sephoras in my city to treat me this bad is absolutely shocking and hypocritical.

Comment: Several weeks later I received an e-mail stating that what had happened was they were unable to process my payment information so my monthly subscription was cancelled but that I could join the waiting list to subscribe again once there is room. To cancel my account and make me wait to join again when the error is the company's mistake is terrible customer service. I was told the payment was not processed and my account was not charged. That was not true. I was charged for two boxes in a row that I never received. It has been 5 months and I have gotten no where with customer service. Also there has been no room on the wait list in that time.As I begin to look online to see if this has happened to anyone else I am seeing that it has happened to a ton of people. I have worked in promotional marketing on a large corporate contract as a brand representative for 6 years now. After reviewing hundreds of claims that Sephora is stealing money from its customers all I am left thinking is, why has there not been a lawsuit over this??? If anyone is involving themselves in litigation for these matters with this company please contact me as my bank records clearly show that my payment was processed though I received no product from them.I will never purchase another item from them no matter what and I am absolutely not interested in subscribing to the MO they box again. Anyone looking for better offers should look into Ipsy and Birchbox (which are the same price as Play!) Or Julep which is pricier but really awesome. I have never been treated so rudely by a company and I think Sephora should be ashamed of how they ate conducting business. A quick search online reveals the company's history with racial prejudice towards anyone who is not white in addition to their shady dealings of stealing money from customers without shipping products. BOYCOTT SEPHORA!!! PASS THE WORD AROUND THE GLOBE!!! THIS COMPANY IS POORLY RUN AND IS UNETHICAL.

Comment: Since the tracking information showed the package had been on my street the day before, I was puzzled as to how my order could already be altered. Additionally, why was anything from my order being altered and given to other customers at no fault of my own? As I worked to frame my questions in a way the "beauty advisor" could understand, throughout continued and extremely frustrating interruptions, the only response I kept receiving was "your items are no longer available. Your items are no longer available. Your items are no longer available." That sentence rang through my head like a broken record. Why are the items that showed they were on my street just yesterday no longer available?The response, again by interruption, was "there is nothing I can do." I asked then if I could speak with anybody else that could explain why my items were no longer available and there was nothing he could do, but he said I would need to hang up, call back, and speak to someone else that way because he would not transfer me. I certainly understand triaging and managing calls in a way that reduces the number of escalations. But there must be a better sense of customer service or lack thereof than to recommend I hang up and speak to someone all over again. I'm shocked that Sephora would train their customer service representatives... Sorry, their "beauty advisors" this poorly. I did exactly as told by this pitiful representative, and was connected with another "beauty advisor". Lo and behold, no notes had been added to my account so I had to re-explain my situation all over again. At least this representative attempted to locate the package to request the drive stop the return--a step in the right direction. Though unsuccessful, he did try to better explain to me why I was no longer going to receive the rewards & a samples I had hand picked. While we decided on picking out new options instead, this "beauty advisor" could not pronounce or explain a single one of my options. He could not explain or remotely describe the items I was supposed to be picking from.I finally agreed to a couple items, I truly had no idea what was picked because my beauty advisor could not tell me. When he couldn't add them to my cart for whatever reason, he told me I would need to wait until his supervisor could help... Which was perfectly fine... Until he said he had no idea when that would be because he doesn't see anybody nearby. And that I might be better off keeping the points and saving them for next time. We'd been on the phone 40 minutes at this point, so I agreed and was provided a new order with fewer and/or completely different products than I originally ordered. After all this, I'm honestly still not completely sure I understand why.How does a multi-million dollar company decide to hire this level of customer service? How does any company for that matter, regardless of net worth, allow that embarrassing level of customer service to take place on their dime? I am absolutely ashamed of the way my calls were handled. Never once have I written a negative review, but I couldn't quite get this out of my head, even after taking several days to sleep on it. Please Sephora, for the sake of the customers that would like to return but are now looking to buy elsewhere, you must address your customer service standards.

Comment: I ordered this curling iron and blow dryer for the holidays and of course it will not be here in time. The correct company answer should have been to send out a Dry Bar blowout bundle to me, and do their own internal investigation. The bundle set I ordered is not cheap and I have been a customer of theirs for years. I should not be inconvenienced because of sloppy employee work or dishonest employees. Not at all happy with Sephora.

Comment: About 20 minutes later I called Sephora customer service only to learn that they NEVER update or cancel orders. What kind of customer service is that? I had placed my order less than an hour before calling, and my update wouldn't have affected my order at all, only how much my credit card was charged. At first they said my only option was to place a whole new order and then ship back the first order once I received it (which is really inconvenient). It was only after stating how upset I was with the company that they said they would look into the possibility of MAYBE canceling my order. I was really shocked and disappointed by their policy, especially considering that I'm a VIB client, which means that I spend hundreds of dollars with them every year. I truly can't wrap my head around their total disregard for customer satisfaction.In addition, earlier this year I had a negative experience with their in-store customer service. The beauty adviser I was matched with to give me recommendations on a number of products I needed had very little knowledge of the products in the store and was not helpful in the slightest. I was also supposed to receive a complimentary makeover, but was rudely ignored. I'm almost at the breaking point of just trying to order all my beauty products on Amazon, which I regard as a much more customer-friendly company. They at least let you cancel an order before it gets shipped.

Comment: Last Sunday for the VIB Rouge 20% off sale I attempted to use my gift card for some items. The gift card showed as $73.83 and my remaining balance was $8.77 that came out of my PayPal debit card. Upon checking out I hit 'PLACE ORDER' and I received red lettering that told me the order could not be processed because an item I had in my cart was now out of stock. I was ok with it, so I went back to order something else...however, when I tried to use the gift card for an item that was in stock, it told me I had zero on the card. I then get an email from PayPal telling me Sephora changed me the remaining $8.77 so I thought the order went through after all. So I call to be sure and the rep tells me it was a mistake and that it will take 1-7 days for the money to go back on my gift card or for my PayPal to be credited. I was upset because the sale ended the next day. Later that night the rep called me back to tell me that her supervisor was going to take care of it and I would have my money back within 24 hrs. It has been a week and NOTHING. I see that the 8.77 they took out for the remaining balance has expired in PayPal but my gift card is still at ZERO. So, I call today to find out that now they are saying I never had money on that gift card. Of course I am pissed so now I had to call the store that issued the card and ask them for that receipt. They have to contact their audit department to get it and someone will call me back!! I am so over it with Sephora. They pack products TERRIBLY and ship them only to lose money because the items come damaged and they have to send out another. And that has happened too many times to count & Now this? Horrible customer service, and it is a shame.

Comment: I got to the counter to start the exchange process when the associate at the counter rudely told me "You might be given the lowest price for the exchange. That's just the way it is." I told her that I have heard no such thing before nor is that legal simply because I did not have a receipt. After questioning her about this, she then told me "well that's just the way it is. I'm telling you."I then gave her my credit card to pay for the difference and something had happened on the screen, I think, but she made me stand there and wait without even saying what was going on. I had been in line for about 30 minutes without a word on what was happening. I then said to her that I had to go to work just like she did and that she wasn't the only one that had work today.Finally, with my receipt came an advisory saying I was banned from returning any further items for a period of 180 days because of suspected fraud. First of all I am a regular Sephora customer. I shop at Sephora almost every month. I do throw my receipts away sometimes but I return products that do not work out for me. Not everyone can just throw things away that don't work for them.Secondly if this is Sephora's policy of taking returned items back for a lower price, they need to indicate that on their website. People need to be aware of such policy before bringing back items without a receipt. Not everyone is going to commit fraud by returning items without a receipt. They also need to improve customer service training and retrain employees on how to treat people better and not treat them like a criminal and make it so difficult for them to return something they did not particularly care for. It's a beauty store, different things work for different people.

Comment: As a goodwill gesture, I offered a solution for a credit note for the Melbourne, Australia store for the amount of the double-charge, but this was also declined. Good to know how "important" this company views their customers! I will definitely never shop at this store again anywhere in the world and I would encourage others to do the same. You will be treated like a number and completely ignored if you have any complaints or follow-up queries. Very disappointed!

Comment: I quickly called Sephora and the first person I spoke to basically yelled at me and told me, "Oh you get the money back in 8 days, it's the banks problem". I called my bank and they said it was actually Sephora's issue. I called Sephora back and the put in a complaint and the girl told me I'd have my money back in 3 days. It's been 8 days so I called again. I was told, "Oh actually you live in Canada it'll be 14 business days, you were given the wrong info. For your trouble we can give you 100 points". To be honest I laughed at this. This has been quite the stress for me and I plan to never shop here again honestly. What I do ask is for them to fix their website. The thing I don't understand is how you get charged anyways when it can't simply block the charge and say the info is incorrect before proceeding like every other website. But to be charged twice with no product, having to wait two weeks for a refund (on their mistake by the way) and only offered 100 points. Fix your website Sephora. I read online this has happened to many people. Not all of us are wealthy and have money to throw down the drain. I was of course happy to buy the product once and receive it! Not to be charged twice for nothing and dealing with the headache. Honestly good riddance.

Comment: I then asked if there was someone else I may speak to. One girl walked off a this point and the other (Nicole on her name tag. The only thing there.) Said she was. I knew immediately that this wasn't going to go far so I asked if she was the store manager or assistant manager. She was an assistant manager so I asked to speak to the store manager who was not available. This person Mark ** is apparently never available and does not respond to emails. I returned to the store recently and asked if he was there physically once again he was not. I expressed my concern with a cast member and they suggested I get a hold of a Brian ** the district manager. Neither individual has attempted to make contact with me.Oh wait there is more... my last visit to the store location in hope that I might catch the evasive Mark ** at work. While waiting for him, apparently he was there, but had dipped out for lunch (later discovery) I overheard the 2 very same employees mentioned before discussing ** and how you couldn't tell if they were going to buy make up or blow you up. I left. After all how much can a person take. I already felt short of calling my wife the "N" word (we are **) I was already offended from the related encounter, and to hear further racial commentary propagated by a company employee that holds itself to a "higher standard" was just over the top. After all according to the Sephora employee employment page "YOU ARE THE FACE OF SEPHORA". A side note. After the first related incident I followed up with documentation and I even recorded video with audio every time I went back into the store attempting to meet with Mr. **. I have the ** comment on video with audio and both individuals in frame during discussion. I have offered to share this with Sephora... still no word. If I could post it here I would do so for your viewing pleasure or displeasure. I suppose that the lack of response by Sephora and its management proves that beauty is truly only skin deep and therefore shallow.

Comment: I was furious when I saw that message, so the first thing I did was go onto Google and see if anybody else has encountered this problem. It turns out TONS of customers encounter this problem. I saw that a few of them had their orders cancelled because the billing and shipping addresses were different from each other. My billing and shipping addresses are different, so this might be why they chose to cancel my order.Since Sephora refuses to do business with me I just went directly to the seller's websites (UrbanDecay, BareMinerals, etc) and bought my products there. Today I looked at my bank account charges and I found that Sephora still hasn't removed the charge for $57. It has been 3 business days. I read that it can take up to 7 business days to get a refund, so I will wait and see if they can give me my money back in a timely manner. So I will never shop Sephora online again. I have had a very bad shopping experience that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I will most likely find a different makeup store to shop at once I move back to civilization.

Comment: She said she can move it up to two days. So I call back and get someone else who tells me that is not correct and he doesn't know why I was told that. He said he will send it to his supervisor and I will have my money put back in my account within 24 hrs. Seeing as to how I can't get a straight answer - I call back a third time to confirm that my money which was held, without ANY NOTIFICATION TO ME, will definitely be returned tomorrow. This one told me it takes three business days!!! YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME SEPHORA!!! I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere after this experience and after seeing what other customers have had to go through.

Comment: Yes I spent a lot of money, but many of these items were directly purchased for my sister (before she opened her own account) and as gifts for others. Yes I returned around 25% of what I had purchased, but kept 75% and was under the impression I was not going against any rules or policies. Besides, I was told on the phone that I'm allowed to place multiple orders, return lightly used items, and place more than one order in a day. Here are the 4 reasons Sephora gave for banning me, INSTEAD OF politely asking me to improve my shopping habits to their standards: 1) "Oh, it's your address... it's the same as your sister's. We have a policy against 2 people in one house, so change one of your addresses and problem will be fixed." Address changed. Problem not fixed. 2) Three days later (after another cancelled order): "Oh, it's because your last name is not on your shipping address. We updated it and you can go ahead and order now." Placed orders... NOT fixed. Same result of order being cancelled. 3) Two days after that: "Oh, it's because you need to go into a Sephora store to prove your identity with ID and show proof of address." Done. Took a 1.5-hour bus ride on my day off to do this! Still, they cancelled my orders afterwards. 4) Two more days later: "Oh, it's because the manager in the store didn't type your name into the computer to update your account. Go back and get her to input data because it has to be changed at store-level." Done. And still have cancelled orders two days later after that!When I phoned back a 5th time, which was 9 days after the first cancelled order, I was told that there's a note on my account saying they are not allowed to talk to me and that I have to wait for the investigation team to finish their investigation. But... I'm welcome to shop in the store. Hahahaha... there's no way I'll be giving them any more $ unless this issue is resolved and an apology given. I was VERY polite with them on the phone and each time simply asked one question: "Why?" And now I'm sitting here looking up forums like these to see if this has happened to anyone else. This is real and it's extremely unfair of Sephora. If I've abused my privileges without knowing, they should say so. Please take note if you hit VIB rouge. This happened the same week I reached that level. Good luck all! :)

Comment: After asking her again she told me that there was a Old Navy and KMART down the block and I should try there. No sooner did she get that out of her mouth when I had relieved myself in my clothes not being able to control it since I was sick. So I'd like to THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN and say I made it to my office which is 1 block from your store. I'm changed into new clothes and undergarments and cleaned up in our Company bathroom. Now to see about a lawyer?

Comment: This is so low-end that I will never buy anything in Sephora again. We don't need them in NYC. We have so many choices. When I have the time, I am writing to Sephora Corporate (CEO Calvin McDonald, Christie Jack- Sr.VP/Retail). In addition, my on-line order was stolen at the Sephora fulfillment center and some illegible signature was scribbled in. Sephora did re-send the products and admitted the problem was at their end. I could go on and on but in essence, who needs this? I'll shop elsewhere. They are a very poorly run, messed up company. They can stay in their own country and they wouldn't be missed at all.

Comment: Upon speaking with a rep, I was told the only thing they could offer me was 200 points added to my account. The discount I should have received was close to $30.00. I waited until the discount period to place the order. They know I am a VIB member and DESERVE the discount. But the best they can do is a lousy 200 points, which of course I cannot use until I place another order. I should have been offered a credit/gift card for the amount of the discount - a no brainer really. With so many other options out there, I am sad to see that Sephora does not value their loyal customers, something I have seen through reading the other reviews here. My instinct at this point is to just send back my order when it arrives. I was going to include a letter stating why, but I am thinking based on what I have read here, that Sephora will not even understand - or care - why I am unhappy. Which makes me wonder why they bother with the survey at the end of the customer service interaction. Just going through the motions, I guess. Time to check out Ulta.

Comment: Fatima says "I need your card". I gave her my shiny red VIB Rouge card. She eye rolls and processes my return, looking at me like I'm a real PITA to her. Then she rings everything up again, -15%, and says "credit card" to pay $176. Hands me my bag "here ya go". WHAT does it take to handle a store promotion right the FIRST time WHAT does it take to be treated politely? Ask me for my card please. Thank me for shopping there. Fatima - your attitude will not take you far in the world. And it'll take a lot to get me to go back to a Sephora in the future. Thank you for listening.

Comment: Based on the other recent reviews, I guess I should consider myself lucky because I actually received my purchase (an item exclusive to Sephora). But the nasty rep neglected my special code items and an email I wrote regarding this has never been answered. Is someone trying to run Sephora's business into the ground? They're behaving like it's their misguided anti-business goal. I for one have stopped ordering anything from Sephora because of their total lack of regard for the customer.

Comment: Sephora refuses to replace the lipstick. I just spent 50 minutes on the phone with Sephora's customer service line, most of that time on hold. I explained the problem, and I pointed out that I am one of their best customers and that this was the first time I was making any kind of request -- I have never before asked Sephora to give me anything or to do anything for me. They said "No", flat out. They pretended that they have no power to do anything for me, that I would have to go back to the store and take it up with the store.I am busy, with a full-time job, and the store is many miles away from where I live or work (I was there on the one Saturday I was free to go shopping; it is now Sunday and I am at my office, and I will be at work all next week). I do not have time to go back to the store over a $36 lipstick that a Sephora salesperson may have inadvertently forgotten to put in my bag (even though I -- of course -- paid for it).Sephora exemplifies corporate greed at its most gluttonous. Women collectively spend billions of dollars with this corporate behemoth. Their "rewards" program consists of awarding points that customers can then redeem for tiny product samples that undoubtedly come out of Sephora's marketing / advertising budget --i.e., calculated to get customers to spend even more money at Sephora rather than actually showing genuine appreciation for their patronage. The points can never be redeemed for products that a customer might actually voluntarily choose. Customers' patronage is never acknowledged in a truly meaningful way, say, for example, with any free product of one's choice under $100. And Sephora's products never, ever go on sale.Sephora's attitude of contempt for its customers is epitomized by its refusal to send me -- one of its most loyal and ridiculously high-spending customers -- a $36 lipstick to replace one that its own salesperson may have forgotten to put into my shopping bag, even though I paid for it. As a consumer and as a woman I am disgusted with Sephora's contempt for, and eagerness to exploit, me. Where possible, I am going to start buying my beauty products from other retailers.

Comment: I asked to speak to a supervisor, and couldn't because one was not there. I was assured that one would contact me. No one has. I have emailed, through the customer service account, on the website. I have not had a response. I have been purchasing items at Sephora for over 16 years. I have never had a problem. I have been a loyal customer. I will no longer purchase from Sephora.

Comment: Sephora, you can see I regularly shopped your store in review of my profile and VIP status and have never returned anything I purchased. I called the (800) number on the declination receipt and was advised they no longer accept returns without an original purchase receipt unless they can find it on my VIP account. Only then will they allow an exchange. I had a hard time conveying - gift - no receipt. The representative had no trouble conveying - too bad, not going to happen. Good grief - I vote with my dollar folks. I would think a very good way of destroying a business especially in today's competitive retail market would be to not stand behind what you sell, arbitrarily change your return policy (I looked it up on my phone, online as I was standing in the store) and then by all means inconvenience your customers in the process and demean them. I won't lend another dollar to support such bad business practice.

Comment: Prior to this, my shipping information was unavailable, saying that it had been delivered on 2/16 when I placed my order on 2/15. I had called their customer service number, waited on hold for 20-30 minutes, was hung up on, called again, waited another ten minutes, and was then berated by the customer service rep for approximately ten minutes as she proceeded to tell me that I knew nothing about the company, nothing about their shipping processes, and basically insulted my intelligence about the company. (I like to keep in mind that I make pretty frequent orders online and in store, possibly once a month, maybe more frequently than that.) She had hung up on me, providing me with nothing, and I emailed the company several times asking about shipping and why it said the product was delivered, explaining my experience with the customer service rep, etc. Today when I received my product, I saw that I did not have the foundation so I called again. I waited for twenty minutes on hold and when I finally spoke to someone, she had told me that there was nothing they could really do. They refunded me half of my purchase and told me that instead of them fixing their mistake, that I would have to buy the foundation without the set. The foundation itself is 42$ where the set is 46$ (beauty blender/foundation set). It was absolutely pointless and I have never been more frustrated by a company's ignorance and behavior. It genuinely makes me never want to shop at Sephora again, when I have always loved their products and have always loved the service I received in stores. I am to the point where I may never shop there again.

Comment: I ordered 252 worth of product recently and it was suppose to be delivered 2 business days. However, 10 days later and still awaiting my order. I emailed Sephora twice asking for a response regarding my concern on the shipping and did not receive an email back. I called the 877 number, and was informed by a rep NOT to email them because it never goes anywhere and to call Sephora directly, which I HAD to if I wanted any answers. My original concern pertained to shipping and how long it was taking, but after speaking to their representative about my order she stated that she would only able to give me "Beauty Points" and suggested I pick up my order at UPS if I couldn't wait until the delivery day. Cheap way to perform business I feel. Future purchases are best done at the store or Ulta.

Comment: Well the wait on hold was at least 15 minutes, AT LEAST. I finally get someone on the phone and I would say they were very awkward but that's IMO. I explained what the issue was and told them about how the website denied my card BUT still took $375 out of my bank account. How exactly is that possible? Anyways, I asked her if she could look up this order that was "denied" but I was still charged for and she is asking me things like "ma'am what all was in your shopping cart" and let's be honest I can't name every single thing off the bat and so I listed a few things and thought that would be enough to prove the authenticity of the order that I'm trying to make. Apparently she couldn't pull up this order and then asked how much was I charged.Not being near my computer because I get no cell signal in my downstairs apartment I just say what is was around. She still is saying she doesn't see what I'm talking about like I'm insane. So how is it that they can charge me but not pull up what they charged me for. I'm extremely frustrated and I will never shop online there again. And as for trying to get everything straightened out over the phone FORGET IT. Might as well not spend my money on a place that has no clue what they are doing and are zero help on the phone.

Comment: Judging from the reviews I have seen, I'm not holding my breath on getting a refund from them. I will most likely have to open a case with PayPal. Absolutely ridiculous! I will never, ever buy from Sephora again. I went to Amazon and reordered a different brand. I just can't believe they treat their customers this way. Do not purchase from Sephora online. YOU WILL GET NO SUPPORT WHAT SO EVER!!!

Comment: Back in August, I ordered a primer that they don't carry in the store, based on good reviews and the brand which is one I like. As it happens, it balled up and broke me out. Hence, I sent it back using Sephora's prepaid label and I can see via tracking that they received it in the middle of September. Well, it's almost December and I have yet to receive a refund. I have called and emailed numerous times about this and no one can give me an explanation! When I email, they tell me to call. When I call, they put me on hold and transfer me to another person who is also of no help. It was only $35 so I will take the loss on it but it gets worse...A week before Halloween, I ordered some makeup items for my daughter's costume and despite having access to free "2 day flash shipping" this order took almost a week to go out! Again, I had to call them and the rep kept telling me the items were on their way yet could give me no proof of tracking! When I finally got frustrated, she HUNG UP ON ME!!! I then called in and asked immediately to speak with a supervisor, who was much nicer but ultimately, couldn't give me much information. The package finally turned up... after Halloween.Most recently, I placed a large order to take advantage of the 20% off sale they have twice a year. Out of the 15 products I ordered, I wasn't fond of two of them so I very hesitantly sent them back. Thankfully (or so I thought) I received an email confirming that they were received and that I'd receive another email once they process the return. Well, it's been over a week and still no email. So I emailed them about this and received an email back stating that they cannot help me via email; I have to call in. Why have a customer service email address if you refuse to answer people? It's not as if I sent them an email lacking information or details. I provided very specific info in regard to my order and they took almost two days to tell me that!? Come on, that is completely unacceptable. Are the employees in their customer service department not trained at all? Do they just not care? I don't know but their whole way of conducting business is questionable and I refuse to put up with it any longer. These products equal more than $35 so I will be filing a dispute with my credit card company this time around and I encourage anyone dealing with a similar situation to do the same! Anyway, I called them today on my lunch break and wasn't able to stay on hold long enough to receive help (ha, not like I'd have been helped anyway) so I use that term very loosely. Frankly, I don't want to call them in the very little time I have after work with my children and my husband. They should be able to help me within the 45 minutes I spent on lunch not eating, but rather waiting on hold, or via email.Seriously people, nothing they sell is worth the aggravation and flat out abuse from their customer service department. Ulta and Macy's carry many of the same products and they've always managed to treat me like a human being and not steal my money when I returned something. They really need to be held accountable for this nonsense. It seems to happen rather frequently and personally, I'm done with it. They won't see another dime of money. They seem like they don't care, but once more customers start doing the same, it'll add up and they will.

Comment: I felt uncomfortable in that store and I felt I wasn't wanted there. Like they wanted me to shop like a hunter for a deer -- in and out. I decided on a night oil and as I was reading product info another clerk came and offered help. I repeated my story and felt I wasn't welcomed and although she was nicer than the other lady, she was also not knowledgeable and wanted me to decide to buy and get out. I finally settled for Dior, bought only the stuff I ran out of, got some makeup and left. Sephora was not interested in helping me learn more about products. They wanted to make some sale and get rid of me. I was there for about 25 min. Since Dior cost the same at Macy's which is next door, I will go there next time just because of such hostile customer service I encountered at Sephora.

Comment: It has been 42 days since I mailed the package and I still don't have my refund. 6 calls and 3 promises of a 24-48 processing time for the refund and nothing. I didn't even receive a confirmation email when they received and processed the return 10/23/2015. At one point I was told my refund was issued in the form of store credit because I had to specifically ask for it back on my card - which was a bold face lie. I have sent in email inquires that have not been responded to, and each time I call it takes 30+ minute (most of which I'm on hold) for them to "look into it". I am furious with this experience and have spent hours collectively dealing with this joke of a company. A word of advice - buy your beauty products elsewhere.

Comment: On this most recent trip I went to the store to get items that were sold out online and at the same time to return some items that had receipt and also no receipt. All of these items/brands are exclusive to Sephora Canada so it was evident I got them from Sephora because nowhere else sells them and those brands do not ship to Canada. Some of the items were brand new, untouched, and still sealed. Since I do not drive and have a busy schedule, I wanted to do everything in one trip. I had my items and printed the name of the items I wanted to return on paper with their item ID numbers in the hopes to assist the staff in quickly identifying the items and also brought my federal ID with me.They treated me like royalty when I was filling up my shopping bag but when I got to the cashier and mentioned that I had returns or exchanges, especially without receipt, they looked at me with dagger eyes and turned dead cold and straight up rude. This has been my Sephora experience/observation since I joined but it has gotten much worse. The male salesperson who was initially serving me at the cash register asked his supervisor to assist me to make it quicker, and he was very sarcastic and unhelpful. All the while they were whispering into their little headsets about me as if I am a criminal to be looked out for. I saw staff gathering, talking, and eyeing me. With that said I had already purchased thousands of dollars online at Sephora that very same day, and hundreds in that same store visit. Little did they know, or do I say, little do they care.The supervisor who took over informed me the return policy has changed in July, but how was I to know since my last trip was in March. No email was sent to inform customers about the change. She said she could only accept items found in my online history and said she only saw 1 item that was eligible even though I had brand new and sealed Sephora exclusive items right in front of her. When I went home, I looked at my online history and saw several other items that she "missed". Unbelievable is the word. I also have physical receipts from store purchases that were not recorded in my online history, so what is up with that? I have close to 8000 points, not counting points I have already redeemed for samples so where are all my history for those points? And why can't I use points for products I want instead of those samples that do nothing for me?These points come from spending money at Sephora over the years and clearly not from returning stuff or abusing any policy yet they treated me like I was a dishonest cheat and meant nothing to them as a customer, not appreciating or realizing that customers pay their salaries and their bills. To make things worse, the online orders I made were cancelled by Sephora several times due to slight differences in the order of my name and billing/shipping addresses. They did not inform me of the cancellations and I almost missed the promotion altogether and would not have been able to stock up. This repeated itself when I tried with a second card to make the same order. I have had no problems purchasing with my card but only at Sephora online did I have to jump through all these hoops going back and forth with my bank and Sephora itself.When the orders were cancelled, Sephora did not send any emails and they do not release the funds either so the credit cards were charged nonetheless, thereby reducing the available credit to purchase a new order. How seriously ridiculous. This whole gong show of ordering and cancelling took place for 4 days, not to mention going to the store and getting humiliated for no wrong I did. To top it off, I bought online via airmiles.ca to collect miles but because Sephora cancelled my orders, I had to replace those cancelled orders via the phone and all my potential miles are gone. So much for planning ahead and buying online at the strike of the midnight clock when the promotion was activated.High time another retailer brings in brands to Canada so that Sephora Canada wouldn't monopolize the market with marked up prices and abuse regular supporters of the brand. Some of their products have increased by $35 from the year before, thus the 20% discount is basically a write off for the mark up. 100% guaranteed poor customer service/appreciation at Sephora. But on the bright side, at least I am not working there.

The 1-800 number can't help me since this happened at retail but retail district or regional managers cannot be contacted. How can they not care about their customers? I spent $5,700.00 last year alone.I won't be using my 20% this year for the first time in a long, long time. At 60 years old I have learned one very important thing - "There's nothing I need that bad". I will be shopping elsewhere.

And of course, the moment I went and paid, the guy disappeared. This happened in Athens, Syntagma store in Greece. I thought I'd give Sephora a second chance and see what they can do about this.

Comment: I went back to the store to purchase the correct color. When I got to the register I told them it was a gift. The clerk was almost ballistic. She wanted my driver's license and said that I probably could not return it w/o receipt. She entered everything in the computer (remember this was an exact exchange) and out popped a receipt saying that I was banned from returning anything from Sephora with or without receipt for 365 days!!! I was with my DIL and granddaughter who looked at me in horror as the clerk implied I had been making fraudulent returns. There was a telephone # on the receipt to call if you wanted to know why you were a criminal. I am old and now I am so angry I could kill. I called the company and they told me to call Sephora. I called Sephora and after waiting for 45 minutes spoke to someone who knew nothing. She had never heard of such a thing.Asked to speak to Supervisor but after going back and forth with questions from so called Supervisor from her to me was told that Supervisor would call me back. I cannot keep going with this complaint but long story short there is a company called "The Retail Equation" that tracks your transactions and decides if you are a criminal or not. I order my return report from them and I had only returned 2 single items since 2012. This qualified me as a criminal!!! I have emailed Sephora 4 times for an answer and just get return emails, a week later, stating their return policy without any mention of what to do if you do not have a receipt. I give up, I am going to die with this criminal record. However, I plan on telling everyone I know about how they can expect to be treated when they go to return something that they have received as a gift from Sephora.

Comment: Then they came up with a solution, which was opening a dispute through my bank. I asked the representative "So once I submitted the dispute and get the approval, I can get my refund back right?" The representative answered "Yes, I will put a note on your order to make sure, so once you submitted your dispute, you will get all your refund back." And now is the end of May. I received a letter from my bank stating that my dispute was denied and the reason was "the merchant has informed us that the merchandise has been delivered." So I called them back and the customer service told me that since this case is close, there's nothing they can do and suggested me to contact my bank about this. This is ridiculous. If I already knew you will deny my request, what's the point to contact my bank? Worst online shopping experience ever. I definitely will not order from Sephora anymore. SHAME ON YOU.

Comment: She was was saying things like "You didn't get this here because I can't find the transaction." I assured her and showed her on my Sephora page that it had been purchased from her store. She said she had to give me a store credit for 2 things, but was able to return the one which I had the receipt. When she handed me the return receipt, she threw it down on my hand very forcefully. I had NEVER been treated so rudely before from Sephora, which is very disappointing. She had a few other coworkers help her with the return and they never smiled or said hello and when I was trying to explain something, they would ignore me and talk to each other.They were treating me as it was a huge inconvenience for them and I apologized but then realized that "I am the customer" and that it is not my fault because I was told I could have a hassle free return. I left the store extremely upset and almost in tears and told my mother and sister in law what a horrible experience I had just had. It ruined my day and I will definitely tell everyone I know how horribly I was treated.

Comment: Well Sephora.com just INSISTS I live in Murray when I do not...... and of course as a result, it caused my billing information not to match the shipping address. My address is correct on my end, not correct on Sephora's. I try to edit the information because after the first decline, it doesn't say on the site that there was a billing info problem, it just said my card was declined. I kept checking my balances and the money was in the account, so I attempted twice more. Big mistake.The total amount of the order $145.32 was placed on hold three times in my account for a total of 435.96! I called Sephora Customer service 4/3 and all they can say is I have to wait 1-7 Business days. Well its 4/13 and I have been patient, but the funds are still on hold. Why can't you guys just let people enter in their matching information. I call my bank and the funds won't be back till tomorrow, in total about 11 days of utter nonsense because Sephora has to be contrary. Auto correcting my address does nothing to help me or you. I guess Sephora is into losing $150.00+sales on a regular basis. I will probably be buying my cologne from Ulta from now on. Less headache and nicer staff anyway. How does Sephora stay in business will all the sales they reject online and in the stores?

Comment: I contacted customer service and spent over 30 minutes on hold and speaking with two people with the same refrain - "there is nothing we can do, it needs to be redeemed at a freestanding Sephora store." One of the persons told me to use while on vacation. I feel like they highly misrepresented this product and the company. It should not be sold online if it cannot be redeemed online and there should be a better warning that the company does not back up or support its products company-wide. I have looked at many sites about the company and I will no longer support them with my purchasing money.

Comment: I just ordered some more stuff online with Sephora, so I am hoping all goes well with that. I am reading horror stories with online orders. Yikes! I am determined to get my skin back to fresh and glowing like it was pre pregnancy. It's only been a few days, but just my skin tone and feel has already massively improved. ** is the best and knows what she is doing!!!
